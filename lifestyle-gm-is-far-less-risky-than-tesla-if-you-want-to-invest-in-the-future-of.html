Today, the self-driving car division has <a href=# id=3226160f-79e9-5ebd-b927-885c96b50847>received valuation estimates as high as $43 billion</a> — that's more than 80% of GM's total market value.</p><p>And while some analysts would like to see GM spin off Cruise, Morningstar says it's a little too soon for that, given its non-existent revenue and customer base currently.</p><p>"We are arguably old-fashioned, but we prefer to see a viable business before GM even considers a transaction," said Whiston. "The addition of SoftBank and Honda as Cruise shareholders suggests to us that GM is open to a spin-off in some form in the future, but exactly when is hard to say."</p><p>Of course, without Cruise, says Whiston, "GM would not have the option value of AVs anymore other than possibly selling AVs to Cruise. But even beyond the bells and whistles of self-driving cars, there are other reasons to like GM, says Morningstar, which has a "fair value" estimate of $45 for the stock — 23% above Wednesday's prices.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"We do not think the turnaround story is complete," says Whiston, "and in the next downturn, we think GM will prove to skeptics that it really is a different company."</p><p>Shares of GM are down 12% since the beginning of the year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8uinZ6rpK65pnnGpmSiq12brrN5y56qrGWinsCsxYytn5qmXamytLjAZqCfZamkwm7DwKerZqyfYravwsSsq2ahnmLBqbGMn6ytraKaerCyjq%2Bunq5mo7s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
