More contact</p><p>Public display of affection is not just for horny teenagers, it is a valid way of showing continuous interest, and it means a lot to women. In public and private, don't forget this.</p><p>Gifts given to a woman are never insignificant. Never. No matter how small, it means a lot to her, especially if it's a thoughtful one.</p><p>3. Be attentive</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>To her mood, and body language. Some women bottle up their discontent but they are hardly able to guise it.</p><p>Pay attention to her as much as you can, you'll be surprised at the length you'll go with that babe if you do that.</p><p>4. Love notes/ cute texts</p><p>Women are not men, and absolutely desire these things. It means a whole lot to them.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>So, make it short and heartfelt, hilarious, silly and at other times sexy and nasty... just keep the texting and love notes steady.</p><p>Nothing beats time spent together. All the words of endearment don't mean jack if you do not spend time with that girl.</p><p>6. Plan surprises</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>As your budget permits, bruh... or rather, as recession permits.</p><p>7. Unrequested favours</p><p>Women love things being done for them. So... her car needs servicing? Roll up on a Saturday morning, drive the car to the mechanic's and bring it back in prime condition...</p><p>Point is, whatever will make your girl realise that you are actually looking out for her, and that you truly care, just do it.</p><p>8. Listen more</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Asking a girl to be yours is basically the same as asking to be her best gist mate, best friend and confidant.</p><p>9. Genuine change</p><p>If she complains about something you can work on, then work on it and be a better man for her.</p><p>Partners are meant to make each other better, right?</p><p>10. Never forget these things</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Constantly doing these things and any other thing that might be particular to pleasing your girl and making her happy should also be your goal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7xaipZqWVo3pyfIywmLKrXam8br%2FHqK5msZ%2Bqv268wKurp52iYsGprdNmsKitXZawtcHApaOyZZOWv6Z72KFncp2mpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
