No, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not because we&nbsp;argue a&nbsp;lot or&nbsp;because of&nbsp;children (we&nbsp;don’t have children), but just because we&nbsp;like it&nbsp;this way. It&nbsp;seems like it’s not a&nbsp;big deal, right? You sleep in&nbsp;different bedrooms or&nbsp;don’t go&nbsp;on&nbsp;vacations together&nbsp;— who cares? The most important thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy. But in&nbsp;fact, when you set your own rules in&nbsp;your <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, you might encounter stereotypes that might make you think you’re doing it&nbsp;all wrong.</p><p>Especially for <strong>Bright Side,</strong> I’ve decided to&nbsp;talk about why we&nbsp;prefer to&nbsp;sleep this way, what advantages it&nbsp;gives&nbsp;us, and&nbsp;I will also share the reactions of&nbsp;our friends and relatives.</p><p><h2>How it&nbsp;all started</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d8/501/16dd8b5190a15e0b55e4319b16.jpg><p><strong>Once, I&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;in&nbsp;bed alone</strong>. And I&nbsp;was totally sure that&nbsp;I had gone to&nbsp;bed with my&nbsp;boyfriend. When I&nbsp;snuck into the adjacent room, I&nbsp;found him sleeping peacefully on&nbsp;the couch. I&nbsp;thought, “Okay, I’ll deal with this in&nbsp;the morning.”</p><p>During breakfast the next day, we&nbsp;had this kind of&nbsp;a&nbsp;talk:</p><p><strong>—&nbsp;I&nbsp;lost you last night, why did you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the other room?</strong></p><p><strong>—&nbsp;You know, I&nbsp;couldn’t fall asleep. You were twisting and turning and breathing loudly and&nbsp;I woke up&nbsp;every time you moved.</strong></p><p>—&nbsp;Hmm, okay. I&nbsp;never knew&nbsp;I breathed loudly.</p><p><strong>The same thing happened the next night</strong>. We&nbsp;fell asleep together and we&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;separately. So, I&nbsp;realized that we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;talk about&nbsp;it.</p><p>In&nbsp;the conversation, <strong>we&nbsp;realized that it&nbsp;was hard for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;sleep together</strong>. My&nbsp;boyfriend remembered all our arguments that happened because he&nbsp;hadn’t slept enough: he&nbsp;snored, I&nbsp;woke him&nbsp;up, he&nbsp;didn’t have enough sleep, and he&nbsp;was irritated. Sometimes, I&nbsp;snored, he&nbsp;woke me&nbsp;up, and then&nbsp;I was unable to&nbsp;fall back asleep. <strong>Often, one of&nbsp;us would wake up&nbsp;because it&nbsp;was hot or&nbsp;because the other one got up&nbsp;to&nbsp;drink some water</strong>, and once&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;weird dream and&nbsp;I poked my&nbsp;boyfriend right in&nbsp;the eye.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a3/f16/b9c7b651e88cfbce8546b1e2e6.jpg><p>Besides, <strong>we&nbsp;realized that we&nbsp;had completely different sleep schedules</strong>. At&nbsp;the time, I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;very flexible work schedule, so&nbsp;I was at&nbsp;the peak of&nbsp;my&nbsp;activity in&nbsp;the evening and at&nbsp;night&nbsp;— I&nbsp;could watch movies and read books until midnight and&nbsp;I woke up&nbsp;at&nbsp;about 9&nbsp;a.m. —&nbsp;10&nbsp;a.m. And my&nbsp;boyfriend was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;at&nbsp;work by&nbsp;9&nbsp;a.m., so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was very important for him to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;good night’s sleep. However, because of&nbsp;the problems that were caused by&nbsp;sleeping together, neither of&nbsp;us could sleep more than 6-7&nbsp;hours. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, <strong>both he&nbsp;and&nbsp;I became more irritable, tired, and nervous</strong>.</p><p>So&nbsp;<strong>we&nbsp;came to&nbsp;the conclusion that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;best for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;different bedrooms</strong>, and fortunately, we&nbsp;had enough space. I’ll be&nbsp;honest: in&nbsp;the beginning, I&nbsp;didn’t have the same opinion about sleeping separately as&nbsp;my&nbsp;boyfriend. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;little weird for me&nbsp;because&nbsp;I was used to&nbsp;the fact that people sleep together. My&nbsp;parents started sleeping separately only after their 25th wedding anniversary. And my&nbsp;boyfriend felt great: he&nbsp;fell asleep much faster, he&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;easily, he&nbsp;made breakfast for&nbsp;us, and went to&nbsp;work happy.</p><p>Finally,<strong> our arguments stopped almost completely&nbsp;— most of&nbsp;our reasons for arguing just disappeared and both of&nbsp;us became much calmer in&nbsp;general</strong>. Besides, we&nbsp;started to&nbsp;work together much better&nbsp;— where before, it&nbsp;was hard for both of&nbsp;us to&nbsp;get up&nbsp;and collect ourselves.</p><p><h2>What science tells&nbsp;us</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/347/10d/2ba3015815a1b95fd3588c1d51.jpg><p>I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;read something scientific about this question, and&nbsp;<strong>I found a&nbsp;book written by&nbsp;professor of&nbsp;sociology,</strong> Paul C. Rosenblatt, called <a href=#>Two in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Bed: The Social System of&nbsp;Couple Bed Sharing</a>. <strong>He&nbsp;came to&nbsp;the conclusion that sleeping together often leads to&nbsp;the development of&nbsp;<a href=# title=psychological data-link=tag>psychological</a> problems</strong> and can even cause <a href=# title=insomnia data-link=tag>insomnia</a>, or&nbsp;some other disorders. The scientist talked to&nbsp;dozens of&nbsp;married couples and found that the bedroom is&nbsp;often the “<strong>center of&nbsp;tension in&nbsp;the house.</strong>” So, spouses often argue over little everyday things, like if&nbsp;it’s okay to&nbsp;let pets in&nbsp;the bed, or&nbsp;if&nbsp;it’s normal to&nbsp;eat or&nbsp;smoke in&nbsp;bed.</p><p>Besides, there are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;conflicts that start because of&nbsp;snoring, watching&nbsp;TV, fighting for the blanket, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;glowing mobile phone screen. Finally, spouses often fight over the temperature in&nbsp;the bedroom: some people like it&nbsp;hot and others like it&nbsp;cold. <strong>The professor claims that, in&nbsp;most cases, the problem can easily be&nbsp;solved just by&nbsp;sleeping separately, but people can’t fight the stereotype that sleeping together is&nbsp;far more natural</strong>.</p><p>Another sleep expert, <a href=#>Dr. Neil Stanley</a>, gave a&nbsp;speech at&nbsp;the British Science Festival and said, “<strong>Sleep is&nbsp;a&nbsp;selfish activity. Don’t share it&nbsp;with anyone.</strong>”</p><p>Psychologists also <a href=#>say</a> <strong>that for men’s psyches, the necessity to&nbsp;share the bed with someone is&nbsp;an&nbsp;irritation</strong>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;their nature to&nbsp;protect the place where they sleep from a&nbsp;possible enemy. So, when there is&nbsp;someone next to&nbsp;a&nbsp;man at&nbsp;night, he&nbsp;can’t fully relax. <strong>The thing&nbsp;is, when people sleep together, their nervous system can’t relax and have a&nbsp;good rest</strong>. And it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not as&nbsp;bad for women&nbsp;— it&nbsp;is&nbsp;easier for them to&nbsp;deal with these troubles than it&nbsp;is&nbsp;for men who find sleeping alone much more comfortable. I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;it’s true or&nbsp;not, but it&nbsp;was true for my&nbsp;boyfriend.</p><p><h2>The horrors from forums for women</h2></p><p>There is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;very popular opinion that <strong>different beds for a&nbsp;husband and his wife is&nbsp;the first sign that there is&nbsp;something wrong with their marriage</strong>. Or, different blankets is&nbsp;the first sign and different bedrooms if&nbsp;the most obvious signal that this relationship is&nbsp;doomed.</p><p>I&nbsp;learned this from forums for women where everyone agreed: <strong>sleeping separately is&nbsp;completely awful</strong>. The arguments went like this: What about sex? What about spooning? Here is&nbsp;a&nbsp;classic answer to&nbsp;these types of&nbsp;questions:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da7/3d2/2c4099518fbe322eafeefb82a6.jpg><p>After I&nbsp;read a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;these comments, <strong>I&nbsp;found that the old stereotypes about sleeping together were still deep inside&nbsp;us</strong>. Our grandmothers believed in&nbsp;different signs and superstitions that could ruin a&nbsp;marriage. Some people will definitely remember this: don’t go&nbsp;to&nbsp;sleep until you make peace. They tried to&nbsp;follow a&nbsp;simple logic: if&nbsp;most people do&nbsp;this, this must be&nbsp;the right thing to&nbsp;do. <strong>Sleeping separately, or&nbsp;not going on&nbsp;vacation together is&nbsp;a&nbsp;shock</strong>.</p><p>I&nbsp;actually used to&nbsp;think that in&nbsp;the 21st century nothing could surprise me&nbsp;about relationships, but&nbsp;I was so&nbsp;wrong! <strong>Sleeping in&nbsp;the same bed under the same blanket is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;very important thing.</strong></p><p><h2>The examples of&nbsp;celebrities</h2></p><p>By&nbsp;the way, it&nbsp;turns out that a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US are <a href=#>interested</a> in&nbsp;sleeping separately. A&nbsp;study actually showed that about&nbsp;<strong>31% of&nbsp;people who were asked, would like to&nbsp;sleep separately</strong>. That’s consistent with a&nbsp;National Sleep Foundation <a href=#>survey</a> that reported <strong>almost one in&nbsp;every 4&nbsp;American couples sleep in&nbsp;separate bedrooms or&nbsp;beds.</strong></p><p>I&nbsp;also found out that <strong>many celebrities prefer sleeping alone</strong>. For example, George and Amal Clooney <a href=#>choose</a> to&nbsp;sleep separately. The reason is&nbsp;that George snores very loudly and Amal’s sleep is&nbsp;never very deep.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39d/fd2/83d5655003b2f767050e684b52.jpg><p>Besides, <strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas</strong> also decided to&nbsp;<a href=#>sleep in&nbsp;different bedrooms</a>. Catherine once said that she didn’t want to&nbsp;look unattractive in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;her husband, so&nbsp;she and Michael agreed to&nbsp;sleep separately. <strong>Who knows, maybe this is&nbsp;why they have been happily married for 19&nbsp;years?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/702/37f/97afc85c31857fda238bba2c78.jpg><p><h2>Changes for the best</h2></p><p><strong>During the 7&nbsp;years that my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I have been sleeping in&nbsp;different bedrooms, our life has improved a&nbsp;lot</strong>&nbsp;— I&nbsp;am completely sure about this and <strong>our relationship hasn’t gotten worse</strong>. More than that, we&nbsp;got married after about 5&nbsp;years of&nbsp;sleeping separately. It&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that <strong>separate rooms not only allow&nbsp;us to&nbsp;sleep well</strong>, but they also make&nbsp;us more independent because every person wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;alone sometimes.</p><p>Honestly, at&nbsp;this point, I&nbsp;don’t think that&nbsp;I could fall asleep hugging someone. <strong>The fact that&nbsp;I love a&nbsp;person doesn’t necessarily mean that&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;the same bed with them</strong>. When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;sex, for&nbsp;me, sex and sleep are 2&nbsp;completely unrelated things. <strong>I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;idea where the stereotype about having sex before going to&nbsp;sleep came from</strong>. But we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;habit of&nbsp;coming into each other’s bedrooms before sleep, kissing each other, and saying goodnight. <strong>Besides, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;make up&nbsp;for the lack of&nbsp;tactile contact, we&nbsp;just lie in&nbsp;bed and hug during the day</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df4/246/56972f5b37b0bad0d8031465c1.jpg><p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;are going on&nbsp;vacation we&nbsp;don’t book 2&nbsp;separate rooms, we&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;the same room. However, if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible, we&nbsp;book a&nbsp;room with 2&nbsp;single beds. Besides, <strong>it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not as&nbsp;important to&nbsp;have good sleep</strong> when you are on&nbsp;vacation, you can always take a&nbsp;nap on&nbsp;the beach or&nbsp;at&nbsp;some other time.</p><p>What about our friends? They’re split into 2&nbsp;groups. Some of&nbsp;them were pretty skeptical and they said that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;hard for them to&nbsp;fall asleep without hugging their partner. <strong>The others said, “Wow, this is&nbsp;cool! Unfortunately, we&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small apartment, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;can’t try that.”</strong></p><p>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bit harder with our relatives. My&nbsp;mother-in-law was very sad and she said that it’s bad that now we&nbsp;are not able to&nbsp;sleep together anymore... <strong>My&nbsp;mother said, “Live as&nbsp;you wish,</strong> but when you are going to&nbsp;come visit&nbsp;us, bring 2&nbsp;sets of&nbsp;bedsheets.”</p><p><h2>Advice</h2></p><p>The most important thing I’ve realized is&nbsp;that <strong>all couples are different and there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;such thing as&nbsp;one right answer on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;family life</strong>. If&nbsp;you are uncomfortable and you know exactly how to&nbsp;improve the situation, <strong>talk to&nbsp;your partner</strong>. Talk a&nbsp;lot but stay calm. <strong>Explain your position</strong>. Just don’t do&nbsp;this while you are in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;an&nbsp;argument, this will only make the situation worse.</p><p>I&nbsp;understand that this may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit too obvious, but many people have forgotten about how important it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;talk about things as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple. <strong>Make sure that your partner understands that there is&nbsp;nothing personal about your decision, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;just more comfortable for you this way</strong>. Ask your partner to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;understand you. Maybe if&nbsp;one person in&nbsp;a&nbsp;partnership doesn’t like this idea, you can try to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;compromise, for example, sleep separately a&nbsp;few times a&nbsp;week.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about this way of&nbsp;sleeping?
