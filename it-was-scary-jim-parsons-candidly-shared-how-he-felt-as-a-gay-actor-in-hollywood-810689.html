But it’s a&nbsp;whole other story when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>. Actors and actresses worry about their followers, their reputations, and upcoming rejections from production companies. Today, we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;deeper and see how Jim Parsons, the talented actor from <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, feels about&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;came out a&nbsp;few years ago.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af3/02c/d3dcad5c04a4f970931630df14.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;2012, Jim Parsons quietly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>came out</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gay man. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;new <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>profile</a> in&nbsp;the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> star matter-of-factly described that he&nbsp;was “gay and in&nbsp;a&nbsp;10-year relationship.” Parsons never explicitly discussed his sexuality or&nbsp;comments in&nbsp;the written statement, and when contacted, his rep had no&nbsp;further comments.</p><p>“Once I&nbsp;came out to&nbsp;myself and admitted it&nbsp;to&nbsp;myself, the only people [left] were my&nbsp;family, sadly, but that’s kinda the way it&nbsp;goes. Everybody else&nbsp;I worked with knew, but&nbsp;I was doing theatre and&nbsp;I was still in&nbsp;school... It&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lowkey</a>, it&nbsp;was out of&nbsp;the public eye. There were no&nbsp;high stakes.”</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;loves to&nbsp;play roles where he&nbsp;can embrace his true self.</h2></p><p>Jim Parsons <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a> that in&nbsp;recent years, he&nbsp;has experienced “an&nbsp;awakening” about how much he&nbsp;enjoys “bringing myself to&nbsp;the work” when playing characters that identify as&nbsp;LGBTQ+. Parsons, 49, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that “the majority” of&nbsp;the roles he&nbsp;gets offered are for gay characters: “I&nbsp;wouldn’t necessarily call it&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;LGBTQ+ content, but there are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;gay characters that&nbsp;I get offered,” Parsons said when asked what kind of&nbsp;scripts he’s sent. “The majority, I&nbsp;would say, that&nbsp;I get offered are gay.”</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;role model.</h2></p><p>When discussing being openly homosexual in&nbsp;Hollywood, Parsons said he&nbsp;“grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;time where the first thing&nbsp;I think of&nbsp;every time is&nbsp;when Ellen [DeGeneres] <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>came out</a>.” Then he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a> that it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;exciting and as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;it&nbsp;helped him ultimately, it&nbsp;was still so&nbsp;scary for him as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gay person who wanted a&nbsp;career on&nbsp;the same road, in&nbsp;the same industry. “So, it’s been a&nbsp;long time coming.”</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;<i>The</i> <i>Big Bang Theory</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/753/fd6/e880715880b2f801226c29a20e.jpg><p>Jim was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>concerned</a> that coming out as&nbsp;gay while filming <i>The</i> <i>Big Bang Theory</i> might “cause trouble.” He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a> that times have changed and that it’s way easier now to&nbsp;tell somebody you are gay “than it&nbsp;was 20&nbsp;years ago.”</p><p>“So&nbsp;I&nbsp;was scared. I&nbsp;wasn’t scared about losing my&nbsp;job. And I&nbsp;wasn’t scared to&nbsp;the point of&nbsp;denying my&nbsp;sexuality. But I&nbsp;was scared enough to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;my&nbsp;mission not to&nbsp;talk about&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;was scared enough to&nbsp;be&nbsp;nervous the first time&nbsp;I was even nominated for the Emmy. And I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was scared</a> that it&nbsp;might cause trouble, quote unquote, for our big television show.”</p><p><h2>His love encouraged him to&nbsp;come out.</h2></p><p>Jim Parsons has discussed how <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>meeting</a> his husband, Todd Spiewak, in&nbsp;2002, encouraged him to&nbsp;come out to&nbsp;his family. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that he&nbsp;“immediately knew” the relationship would be&nbsp;significant.</p><p>“No&nbsp;offense to&nbsp;the lovely men&nbsp;I dated before Todd, but somewhere deep inside, I&nbsp;immediately knew that there was no&nbsp;choice left but to&nbsp;deal with this [by&nbsp;coming out to&nbsp;my&nbsp;family] because to&nbsp;not let them in&nbsp;on&nbsp;this person&nbsp;I had met was to&nbsp;officially start putting up&nbsp;these lifelong barriers,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>Now he’s a&nbsp;happily married man.</h2></p><p>Our favorite <i>The Big Bang Theory </i>star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> Todd Spiewak in&nbsp;2017. When Parsons, for the third time, took home the trophy at&nbsp;the Emmys for playing Sheldon, he&nbsp;drew direct attention to&nbsp;Spiewak in&nbsp;his acceptance speech, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I&nbsp;love... oh, my&nbsp;favorite person on&nbsp;Earth, Todd Spiewak.”</p><p>What other movies or&nbsp;shows do&nbsp;you know Jim Parsons from?
