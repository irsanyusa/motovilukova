Yet, as Too Hot to Handle star Harry Jowsey joins the show, it seems that fans are not in favor of his inclusion.</strong></p><p>Jowsey and pro partner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rylee Arnold</a> have been subject of romance rumors since season 32 began, and fans apparently think that their flirty chemistry is not needed for the tour. Be that as it may, many people from the internet are still curious if there really is blossoming love between them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-jowsey-to-perform-on-dancing-with-the-stars-tour-starting-february>Harry Jowsey to Perform on Dancing With The Stars Tour Starting February</h2><p>As per the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS Live Tour</a> website, Jowsey will take the stage starting February 20 to March 26. His stint comes after mirrorball trophy winner Xochitl Gomez and Bachelorette star Charity Lawson become guest performers of the show.</p><p>Jowsey will appear for shows in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Missouri, and Colorado. He will also perform for the tour in Utah, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, and California.</p><p>“I’ve never been on tour. I’ve never done anything like that,” he said during the Lightweights podcast in a December 2023 episode. “I think I’m more excited to meet the people that watch the show. Like I love all the dancers and I love spending time with them and I think that’s a massive reason why I want to go is just hang out with those guys and spend time with, with them.”</p><p>As Jowsey joins the most-anticipated dance tour, he will be together once more with Arnold. And, given their history on DWTS, fans are naturally inquisitive about the two’s present connection. However, at the moment, the two are just really good friends.</p><p>Jowsey has, nonetheless, previously expressed his admiration for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> pro. According to the YouTube star, Arnold has made him learn a lot about himself, and he adores her maturity and morals.</p><p>“She’s everything; she’s such a special human. I can’t believe I got to spend all of that time with her, and now I get to hang with her again. I have so much love for her, she’s incredible,” he said.</p><p>Arnold, interestingly, didn’t rule out any possibility of romance with Jowsey. Admitting that the television personality is “gorgeous,” he said her family would probably approve of Jowsey as her boyfriend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-some-fans-think-he-ll-just-ruin-the-tone-of-the-show>Some Fans Think He’ll Just Ruin the Tone of the Show</h2><p>While some fans are excited that Jowsey will be joining the live tour, several others expressed their worry about his upcoming appearance. On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>Reddit</a>, a DWTS fan got candid that they’re “low-key not looking forward to him joining tour.”</p><p>Apparently, fans think that Jowsey and Arnold might disappointingly steal the spotlight from other DWTS pros. Others also think that Jowsey could distract Arnold from her focus on the tour.</p><p>“This may have been unclear but I’m not suggesting Rylee isn’t a star on her own she clearly is, I just feel like Harry is a distraction to the tour,” one fan wrote.</p><p>“It’s time we accept that Rylee shines on her own with or without Harry,” another fan wrote. “Sure it’ll be magnified when Harry arrives but she’s getting so much praise on TikTok with her tour dances.”</p><p>In the beginning of the year, Arnold started giving a glimpse of the DWTS Live Tour. In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> update, Jowsey expressed his thrill to be with the cast again.</p><p>“Looks so good!! Can’t wait to join you guys,” he wrote.</p><p>“We can’t wait to have you!!!” Arnold replied.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Original_Sophia_KyleRichards_AnthonyAnderson_Tom-Griscom_FOX-220x147.jpg alt="Which Celebrities Were Revealed on This Week’s ‘We Are Family’?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x5qpq7Fdn7y4v8SyZK2nXZ%2B8qrqMna6tq12pvLa%2BjJqqZqqfoq6vr8Rmqa6ln6fAbsPIrZ9mqqmhsqZ5wKulqKSUYrCwutOipa6dXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
