The task at hand, supposedly, was to provide documentary evidence that <a href=#>Imane Khelif</a> of Algeria and <a href=#>Lin Yu-Ting </a>of Chinese Taipei, who through a pair of preliminary-round victories are now assured <a href=#>at least a bronze medal</a> at the Paris Games, do not belong in the women’s boxing category. Khelif fights in her 66-kg semifinal match, against Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand, on Tuesday. Yu-Ting faces Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey in a 57-kg Wednesday semifinal bout.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If anything, the IBA threw even more confusion into the mix—and is likely to expose Khelif and Yu-Ting to more animosity. And if the organization was trying to boost its bona fides and prove it should be running boxing in the Olympics, the IBA failed miserably on that front.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">First of all, this rogue press event—held during the heat of competition, overshadowing exploits on the field of play—started about an hour late, with no official explanation granted. There was chirping that Umar Kremlev, the president of the IBA, was going to make a surprise appearance remotely, and technicians were working on the Russian translation capabilities. The three principals who were slated to speak – IBA Secretary General and CEO Chris Roberts; Dr. Ioannis Filippatos, president of the European Union Boxing Committee and former chair of the IBA’s medical committee; and IBA coaches-committee chairman Gabriele Martelli – were all seated and looked ready to get going. “Guys, you are wasting our time, my god!” a German reporter shouted.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">No one disagreed with that assessment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>The Insidious Scrutiny of Female Athletes' Bodies</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kremlev finally appeared on an electronic screen behind the live speakers. But no one could hear him as he spoke, a 2020-era Zoom issue (maybe he was muted). Twice during the approximately 90-minute session of filibustering, chaotic press questioning, and overall unpleasantness, the microphone feedback sent shudders through the hearts of the some 100 reporters packed into a sweaty room. AV errors aside, the more serious problem was the messaging.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Roberts, for example, started out claiming that the IBA didn’t want to overshadow the Olympics and was only touching down in Paris because of<a href=#> Khelif’s victory last week over Angela Carini </a>of Italy: Carini withdrew after 46 seconds; the controversy exploded from there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/olympics-boxing-iba-controversy-02.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That argument felt specious, since Kremlev had been trying to draw attention to Khelif and Yu-Ting and their supposed ineligibility well before the Games, and many journalists, and a portion of the public, were attuned to it. He told a Russian news agency in 2023 that unspecified tests “proved” that they&nbsp; <a href=#>“had XY chromosomes and were thus excluded from sports events.”</a> This included the IBA’s 2023 Women's World Boxing Championships in New Delhi, from which the organization disqualified the two boxers.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After the opening ceremonies on July 26, Kremlev <a href=#>wrote on X</a> that “the 2024 Olympic Games are outright sodomy and the destruction of traditional values throughout the world and Thomas Bach is responsible for this.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Today Kremlev offered an opening “statement” that was a rambling, nearly 20-minute bizarre airing of grievances. Rather than address the subject at hand, he started by criticizing the opening ceremonies, an event in everyone’s rearview mirror. “As a Christian, the Olympic opening ceremony was something horrible,” he said in Russian through an interpreter. “It was horrible for Christians and Muslim people around the world, all people with a spiritual life.” He argued that Khelif and Yu-Ting’s participation in the Olympics was unfair. “Today we are destroying sport, especially feminine sport,” he said. He went on to claim Bach was corrupt, held himself and the IBA as women’s-rights crusaders—all four press-conference speakers were male—and said the IBA, unlike the IOC, was a true democratic, transparent organization (the IOC <a href=#>has said</a> it stripped the IBA of its governing authority, in part, due to its lack of transparency regarding its financial ties to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned energy company. The IBA <a href=#>said it ended</a> its relationship with Gazprom in 2023. Kremlev said on Monday that he had nothing to hide.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Taiwan Turns Against J.K. Rowling for Stirring Olympic Boxing Gender Controversy</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kremlev seemed hung up on the prize money he said he would be offering the women defeated by Khelif and Yu-Ting at the Olympics, and accused the IOC of hoarding revenues and failing to distribute them to athletes. He returned to knocking the opening ceremonies and Bach and continued to brandish his role as equality and fairness advocate.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It was a chaotic farce,” IOC spokesperson Mark Adams wrote to TIME in an email, in response to questions about the organization’s response to Kremlev and the IBA. “The organization and the content of this press conference tells you everything you need to know about their governance and credibility.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Filippatos brandished his credentials as a gynecologist and in-vitro fertilization specialist and argued that science clearly defines biological sex, despite <a href=#>evidence to the contrary.</a> Medicine, he said, “is not opinion. I know who is woman and man.” He and Kremlev both implied that Khelif and Yu-Ting could be transgender athletes, despite assertions from both athletes’ camps that they are not, that they were born as women and grew up as women.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It may be transgender women,” said Kremlev through an interpreter. “Maybe not.” Kremlev said it was up to Khelif and Tu-Ting to prove that they were women, saying that he, for example, could produce documents to “prove I was a real man, not a woman.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Reporters shouted over one another and threw out questions about the salaries of IBA members and potential political alignments with right-wing politicians in Italy. At no time during the disorganized, frustrating gathering did any IBA member express a shred of sympathy for the online bullying and abuse that Khelif and Yu-Ting have faced.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I finally got a chance to ask Kremlev for his message to the women. At first, he said he didn’t understand the question. I tried again. He didn’t really answer it. He said Algeria and Taiwan were great countries. He fell back on the rules-are-rules canard And he noted that the athletes had high testosterone levels, “like a man.” (The IBA <a href=#>previously said </a>the athletes did not undergo a testosterone exam.) He said he didn’t know these two boxers personally and that the IBA would be ready to offer psychological services if needed (why would the boxers possibly go to the organization causing them heartache for help?).&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kremlev said he was “not here to say they’re bad, others are good. We want people to abide by the rules, that’s all.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In all, despite the buildup, the IBA didn’t offer much new. Despite the officials claiming repeatedly that the test results are private, Roberts gave a timeline of testing for the Khelif and Yu-Ting and promised documentation. As of Wednesday night in Paris, the documentation hasn’t been posted to the IBA website, as press rep assured TIME would happen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some exasperated reporters left early. Khelif’s fellow Algerian Olympic boxer, Roumaysa Boualam, entered the room as the press conference was wrapped in the Algerian flag and shouted her support for Khelif in protest of the IBA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s a very fair discussion to be had about gender participation in sports. It’s a nuanced, difficult subject. This was not the way to do it. By coming to Paris and adding to an already combustible situation, the IBA failed Khelif and Yu-Ting. It failed all athletes, really. It certainly failed itself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGBtfXOEjqKZmmWSpMWqusZmnp6mlJq%2Fbq%2FOp6urp6aav7TFjKmYq6GjYrytxcypoJyrXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
