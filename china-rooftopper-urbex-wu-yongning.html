The <a href=# rel=noopener>practice evolved</a> out of the urban explorer movement, also known as “urbex.” It’s not unheard of for rooftoppers to fall to their deaths.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Wu gained a large following on the Chinese social media network Weibo — he has more than 60,000 followers at time of writing — where he had posted hundreds of photos and videos of himself atop buildings he successfully scaled. His followers began to worry when he stopped posting updates in November.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-12-at-2-06-40-pm.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the time of his fall, Wu was attempting a rooftopping <a href=# rel=noopener>challenge in Changsha</a>, the capital of Hunan province, hoping to claim the 100,000 yuan ($15,000 USD) prize, according to the South China Morning Post.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His girlfriend reportedly called the police on Nov. 9 after he did not return home following the challenge.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He planned to propose to his girlfriend [the day after the challenge],” his step-uncle Feng Shengliang was quoted by the Post as saying. “He needed the money for the wedding, and for medical treatment for his ailing mother.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before his fall, Wu’s Weibo videos had warned viewers not to attempt his stunts.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>In October</a>, a 44-year-old journalist and urban explorer fell to his death from a 22-story building in Chicago.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaGZlfXJ8jpyfoqaRYr%2Bwu8Wtpqmolad6tr7Bnq9mr6VixrC6xqegp59f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
