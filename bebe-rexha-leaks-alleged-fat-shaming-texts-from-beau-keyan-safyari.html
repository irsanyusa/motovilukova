In the screenshot, the producer was seemingly criticizing Rexha for gaining weight.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bebe Rexha Exposes Boyfriend’s Alleged Comments on Her Weight</h2><p>Last Sunday, the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m Good (Blue)</a>” hitmaker shared an extremely personal text message from an unnamed person. Yet, while unspecified in the snapshot, fans have automatically assumed the sender to be her beau, Keyan Safyari. In the now-deleted Instagram story, Safyari was seemingly fat-shaming her under the pretense of being “honest.”</p><p>“Hey. I never said you weren’t beautiful and I never said I didn’t love you. In fact I said how beautiful you are and how much I loved you,” the text reads. “But I always said I would be honest with you and your face was changing so I told you it was…that was the conversation we were having.”</p><p>The message then insisted that Rexha really did change in appearance since she gained 35 pounds. Subsequently, the text explained the comments, bringing back Rexha’s actions in the past.</p><p>“Should I pretend it didn’t happen and that it’s ok? Come on I gain 3 pounds and you call me chubbs and fat. Doesn’t mean you don’t love me,” the text reads.</p><p>The text continued, calling out Rexha to not “weaponize your anger or anxiety or any insecurity” to justify a breakup. Furthermore, the text advised the singer to contemplate and “speak to a therapist” to get to the root of the issue.</p><p>&nbsp;“Let me know if you’d like to speak if you need more clarity. Love you,” the text ended.</p><p>After the leak, fans were quick to assume that Bebe and Safyari had already called it quits. Despite this, neither of the two has confirmed nor denied the speculations.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Singer Bebe Rexha publicly DUMPS her boyfriend and shared text messages of him letting her know she’s gained a little too much weight-AFTER SHE ASKED.</p><p>What is wrong with this text? Sounds perfectly honest and respectful while also holding her accountable! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HNr8typ2xx</a></p>— Alex Clark (@yoalexrapz) <a href=#>July 17, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-are-divided-over-the-issue>Fans Are Divided Over the Issue</h2><p>Amid this controversial Instagram Story, Rexha has received mixed reactions from users online. On Twitter, some of her supporters came to her defense, slamming Safyari and his enablers.</p><p>“Men just love being in a woman’s business and body shaming us like I just will never understand?? S**t p****s me off real bad,” one user wrote.</p><p>“The fact that people in the comments are defending the man and not seeing his gaslighting and manipulation tactics. you trash just like him,” another person stated.</p><p>On the other hand, some people didn’t see anything wrong with the text message. One user even said that the leaked message was sent in a respectful manner.</p><p>“She named him chubby first, which is not right,” a person wrote.</p><p>Last April, Rexha admitted that she felt upset upon knowing that “Bebe Rexha weight” became a trending search on TikTok. The singer then noted that she’s always <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“struggled” with her weight</a>, so she finds it discouraging when people talk about her physique.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_BenDeLaCreme_JinkxMonsoon_Santiago-FelipeGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Drag Stars Jinkx Monsoon, BenDeLaCreme Announce 2023 Tour Dates" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>bebe rexha</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Keyan Safyari</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wZ6ZnmWimsWprYylnJqjo2KurbjEoJydZZaWwW6%2Fx5qkoqaXYsGmxNOsZJ%2Bqn6J6o7HArmSknamWu26%2FwJ%2BwmqqZZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
