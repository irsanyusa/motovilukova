After being called 'small-minded' and toxic <a href=# id=4c2f16d3-bcc7-42fd-8ec6-e6e4a657458e data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>by the actress</a>, Nedu debunked the claim that he hates women.</p><p>He said, "In the past episodes, I may have said some things that may have riled up some people and made you think that I hate women. I don't hate women, I don't. My manager is a woman, I've got 3 beautiful daughters and pretty much everyone around me is a woman so I don't know where that thinking is coming from."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Nedu emphasised that the essence of his podcast is for the guests to feel free enough to be honest and transparent.</p><p>He added, "I hear some of the conversations you people have, I don't hate women. If you're watching my podcast, please watch with an open mind and understand that you are watching a podcast called The Honest Bunch that would be as honest as possible no matter how uncomfortable the truth may be. The truth needs to be said."</p><p>This comes after the dispute between him and Jegede following her appearance on the show where the actress <a href=# id=26951eb0-aaf7-4fdd-a027-e410547b3b7e data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>defended <strong>Yul Edochie's choice</strong></a> to embrace polygamy and <a href=# id=a64a672a-38ac-46f6-a076-5024a36804af data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>take a second wife</a>. After the backlash, she promptly apologised to Edochie's ex-wife, May, for trivialising her pain.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>After that, Nedu posted a shady message on Instagram saying, "If you talk, use your chest to stand by your words. Still, Number 1." Jegede then called him out on Instagram in a lengthy post that same day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGannZSqerit2aiZopldp7KrscKtqmaxpqS7r7GMo5ygnZSawG6vy5qgpqtdqbWiwIyhnGagkamytHnWqKSepl%2Bfsa%2BEym6i</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
