Actually, I lied, seeing your fav celebrity on two shows is even better than one. Some celebrities really love talent shows that are marketed toward people who have their talents</strong>, <strong>and fans like us love to see them on these shows.</strong></p><p>Here are ten singing and dancing celebrities joined the world of talent competition shows on both <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a> and <a href=# class=broken_link>Dancing With The Stars</a>. Pretty soon, JoJo Siwa will join this esteemed list! She’s set to compete in Season 30 of Dancing with the Stars as the first ever contestant to <a href=#>dance with a partner of the same sex</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-gladys-knight>10. Gladys Knight</h2><p>This singer was on Dancing With The Stars in 2012 then returned back to a talent show stage in 2019. Her partner in DWTS was Tristan MacManus and they placed eighth in the season. In The Masked Singer she appeared as Bee and placed third in the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-drew-carey>9. Drew Carey</h2><p>This actor blew the judges away as Llama on The Masked Singer in 2020. By blew them away, I mean he basically lost the competition by coming in 17th place. Thankfully, he did better in Dancing With The Stars. In 2014, he was partners with <a href=#>Cheryl Burke</a> and placed eighth in the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-margaret-cho>8. Margaret Cho</h2><p>This actress almost did exactly the same on each show, I’m not kidding. In 2010 she and Louis van Amstel finished in tenth place on Dancing With The Stars. She went back to the talent show world in 2019 for the first season of The Masked Singer where she placed ninth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-joey-fatone>7. Joey Fatone</h2><p>Fatone is already very comfortable on a stage considering he is a singer and dancer. It shouldn’t surprise you that he did pretty well on both The Masked Singer and Dancing With The Stars. Fatone won second place in DWTS in 2007. He then returned in 2012 for DWTS All-Stars, but he didn’t do so hot. In 2019, he won fourth place in The Masked Singer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-ricki-lake>6. Ricki Lake</h2><p>This actress did really well on Dancing With The Stars, but not too hot on The Masked Singer. In 2011, she placed third in DWTS with partner, <a href=#>Derek Hough</a>. In 2019 she placed seventh in The Masked Singer as Raven.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-antonio-brown>5. Antonio Brown</h2><p>This NFL star was not afraid to show the world that he could put on his dancing shoes. In 2016, he placed fourth in Dancing With The Stars with partner <a href=#>Sharna Burgess</a>. In 2019 he let everyone down when he was the first elimination ever on The Masked Singer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-rumer-willis>4. Rumer Willis</h2><p>This actress did so great in Dancing With The Stars that she decided to come back to competition shows for The Masked Singer. In 2015, she won DWTS, and in 2019 she placed fifth in The Masked Singer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-donny-osmond>3. Donny Osmond</h2><p><a href=#>This music icon</a> showed the world that he’s still got it in both shows. In 2009 Osmond won Dancing With The Stars alongside his partner Kym Johnson. He almost continued his winning streak in 2019 when he was crowned the runner up during the first season of The Masked Singer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-wendy-williams>2. Wendy Williams</h2><p>Sometimes you can have the <a href=#>personality and the looks</a>, but not the talent. Unfortunately, Wendy Williams learned that in these shows. In 2011 she placed tenth in Dancing With The Stars. Eventually, she went on to The Masked Singer in 2020. She didn’t do too hot there either, placing 12th.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-nick-lachey>1. Nick Lachey</h2><p>I think you can already tell me when he was last on <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a>. Now that you remember he just won the show, do you remember him on Dancing With The Stars? In 2017 he placed ninth alongside his partner Peta Murgatroyd.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/V7rZivKbe1o</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1324143304.jpg alt="‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ Star Gigi Goode Announces Trans/Non-Binary Identity" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wp6jnpqinsGqsdJmrqGnXZ2ut7GMm5yepl2ku26uzq2fZqyYmnqurdKknJ1lo567qLHRZpinnF2Zrq%2BvyKeeZq%2BZqbVuwMeeZKyskafAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
