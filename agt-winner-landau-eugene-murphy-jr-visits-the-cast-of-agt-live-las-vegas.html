The jazz singer shared multiple photos from his trip featuring other AGT winners.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-landau-eugene-murphy-jr-continues-to-support-america-s-got-talent>Landau Eugene Murphy Jr. Continues to Support America’s Got Talent</h2><p>On June 2, Landau Eugene Murphy Jr. published photos from his recent trip to Las Vegas. Within the photos he’s seen with fellow AGT alum Dustin Tavella, the Clairvoyants, Duo Transcend, and Kodi Lee. While many of the AGT Las Vegas live cast members reshared the photo, Duo Transcend commented saying “So great to meet you in person! Yay West Virginia!!”</p><p>Since Landau won the series in 2011, he has continued to support the show and it’s contestants. Landau is always live tweeting along with episodes, praising performers, and offering a lending hand to contestants after the series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CeVBDbFr6Ae/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>In current day, Landau continues to lead a successful music career. It seems like Landau’s most recent performance was at the members-only Friar’s Club in New York City. The singer shared a video of him taking the stage solo, as well as performing alongside multiple other <a href=#>jazz artists</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Landau Eugene Murphy Jr. Earns His High School Equivalency Diploma</h2><p>On May 17, Landau shared that he graduated from the Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College’s Adult Education Association Inc. program. Within the photos, the singers certificate shares that he passed the high school equivalency test.</p><p>Along with Landau’s photos, he wrote a heartfelt caption thanking his friends and family for supporting him through the process. He also thanked individual teachers and promoted their program.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CdrjaPzr8I5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic lockdown, the jazz singer began attending online school. The lack of performances gave him the time to earn his high school equivalency diploma. Landau reportedly dropped out of high school in eleventh grade.</p><p>“When I first won America’s Got Talent, I wanted to do it, but my schedule was so busy I couldn’t fit it in,” he <a href=#>said</a>. “This pandemic has been a blessing in disguise for me because it gave me the downtime to focus and get it taken care of.</p><p>Even though Landau already held an honorary doctorate of music from the University of Charleston, he chose to return to school, noting that dropping out was a “<a href=#>haunting</a> mistake.”</p><p>This singer stole America’s heart when he shared the story of fluctuating from one low-wage job to another. He totally turned his life around after winning AGT‘s million-dollar grand prize, a Las Vegas show, and a recording contract with Columbia Records. Due to his success, he continually was busy going from show to show. The singer explained that the lack of performances in 2020 inspired him to return to school.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1361871631.jpg alt="Katy Perry Extends Las Vegas Residency, Introduces New Character" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZq%2BZo7umvoylmKeckap6psHGnqWeZZ2qv7G02Gahq2WmnsCqwNJmq6GdXZiutMCMqJ1mmZepeq211Z5kpZmjYsOms8CsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
