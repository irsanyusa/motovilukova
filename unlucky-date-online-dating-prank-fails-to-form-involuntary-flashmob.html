Of course, the other half of the date would be non-existent, hidden behind the anonymity of the Internet. Their intention was to lure many men to a single spot and create an “involuntary flashmob,” as the men did not realize they were being duped.</p><p>The clincher was that no matter where the fakers were located in the world, they’d be able to watch the gathering online – the payphone meeting place was in view of a public webcam.</p><p>But it appears that the joke was mostly on the pranksters. Those who showed up in person to see (read: mock) the heartbroken would-be daters found just a few stragglers hanging around. <a href=#>One blog could</a> only verify three men who were waiting for a “date,” and others, when confronted, played coy and quickly made up excuses.</p><p>Perhaps it’s a sign that we all don’t believe everything we read on the Internet. Or perhaps it’s understood that real dates aren’t hatched at a bank of payphones in Times Square.</p><p><strong>LIST</strong>: <a href=#>See the 50 best websites of 2010</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAp7HEnWWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWlhZH12e5BtZq6mnKqwrMWMnZitnV2ku621zZ5knZmknruoec%2BrmKejXZuuqrjSZquoZZakv655yKetqKSlo8GivthmnaWZo526sK6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
