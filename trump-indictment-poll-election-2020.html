This is similar to the shares of voters who approved and disapproved of <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Trump’s separate indictment</a> in June over his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While Republicans are more opposed to the 2020 election-related charges than the documents-related indictment (76% to 69%), the opposite is true among independent voters, suggesting a major electoral weakness for the Republican Party’s presidential front-runner. Our latest survey found that 59% of independent voters support the latest indictment, compared with 49% who supported the charges filed in June.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And despite Trump’s attacks on the special counsel’s probe — which his campaign called a “pathetic attempt” to interfere with the 2024 presidential election — voters are slightly less likely to ascribe a partisan motivation to the latest indictment compared with the June charges.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Our latest survey found that 39% of voters believe Trump’s 2020 election-related indictment was&nbsp; primarily out of motivation to damage his political career, compared with 43% who said the same regarding the documents matter. Along with independents, this difference is driven by Republican voters, who are 10 percentage points less likely to label the election-related charges as politically motivated compared with the documents-related indictment.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This could be due to the fact that the bulk of the electorate (57%) sees Trump as “very” or “somewhat” responsible for the events that led to the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>a similar figure to previous surveys</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">With the legal process in the 2020 election case just beginning, voters — led by Democrats and independents — more likely than not expect Trump to face a fair trial (49% to 38%), though the whole ordeal has prompted concerns of domestic unrest and instability among many Americans.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">At 39%, voters are most likely to say they are “very concerned” about violent political protests if Trump is found guilty, suggesting fears of another Jan. 6-style event.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">If Trump <i>isn’t</i> found guilty, 38% of Americans fear for the integrity of the justice system — roughly matching the share who said the same if he <i>is</i> found guilty. And regardless of how the case goes, more than a third of Americans are concerned about domestic political stability.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The initial political implications</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In terms of Trump’s standing with the Republican Party’s potential 2024 primary electorate, we’re going to let the dust settle until early next week when we update <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>our 2024 GOP primary tracker</a>. But Trump’s first two indictments, including his state charges in New York, yielded somewhat stronger support for him — a brief sugar high in his standing with the GOP’s expected electorate — and this week’s survey shows enormous strength for the party’s 2024 front-runner.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Roughly 3 in 5 Republican voters (58%) said Trump should definitely run for the party’s 2024 presidential nomination, marking his highest level of support (as indicated by this particular metric) in surveys conducted since 2021. Meanwhile, almost 7 in 10 GOP voters (68%) said Trump should play a “major role” in the Republican Party, up from 60% in an April survey.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The bottom line: If the past is precedent, the latest indictment is unlikely to shift the trajectory of the race for the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination given Trump’s enormous strength among the party’s electorate. But Trump’s continued presence on the political stage may hurt the GOP’s standing with independent voters they will likely need to win next year, given that over half of them (52%) don’t want him to play a role in the GOP and 64% don’t want him to run again. This may be especially true if voters’ worst fears about political instability come true after Trump’s expected trial.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6m%2FtrnPZqCnnJmYwa6xza1kqaecoXqmuMScq6KnnmJ%2FcX6P</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
