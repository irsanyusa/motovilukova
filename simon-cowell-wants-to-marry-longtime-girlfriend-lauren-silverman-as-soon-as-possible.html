The pair <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">welcomed their son</a> Eric Cowell in 2014 and have had everyone wondering if they will be headed down the aisle any time soon. Now, sources are saying a wedding is just around the corner.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ26wTeFOCO/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Simon Cowell And Lauren Silverman Hope To Get Married Soon</h2><p>Simon and Lauren’s relationship may have started off a bit unconventionally but they have made it work for seven years. He swooped in and romanced Lauren while she was still married to his pal Andrew Silverman in 2013. The couple divorced after&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# class=broken_link>news of the affair broke</a>&nbsp;and Lauren announced she was pregnant with Simon’s child.&nbsp;</p><p>Simon previously suffered a scary <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>fall from his electric bike</a> at his Malibu home. It required him to undergo a six-hour surgery to have a metal rod placed after breaking three vertebrae in his back. He missed the ‘AGT’ and ‘BGT’ live shows as he was recovering in the company of Lauren and Eric at home. Simon has since been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted out in public</a> during a few family shopping trips.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>WATCH ERIC COWELL SING TO HIS INJURED DAD, SIMON COWELL, ON HIS 61ST BIRTHDAY</a></strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">An insider told National Inquirer</a> that “Simon knows he could have died or been paralyzed for life after the accident.” They continued “But the one constant in his difficult rehab after surgery has been Lauren, and he wants to pay her back with a ring.” The insider continued on to say that the pair are eyeing a summer wedding whether it’s in London or America and the ‘AGT’ judge wants to get married now.</p><p>“Lauren has been Simon’s guardian angel. He now sees there is no other person in his life that he can absolutely depend on like her,” they added. After seeing Simon and Lauren’s relationship blossom so much over the past few years, their bond seems to be stronger than ever.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Simon Has Been Engaged In The Past</h3><p>This would not be Simon’s first engagement. Simon met Page 3 model Louise Payne in 1995 and was smitten right from the start. The pair had&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>a three-year-long relationship&nbsp;</a>and Simon eventually popped the question only a few weeks after they first met. But, they broke off the engagement in 1998 because Simon said he wasn’t ready to have children. He wasn’t ready to give up his bachelor lifestyle leaving Louise heartbroken.</p><p>Check out the What’s Hot Video below for a full timeline of Simon’s relationship history leading up to meeting Lauren. He has always been a hit with the ladies but has changed his bachelor lifestyle to settle down for a quieter life in the past decade.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Simon was also previously engaged to makeup artist Mezghan Husainy in 2010. But for Mezghan, much like Simon’s other exes, she struggled with jealousy and the fact that he was close to so many other women that he previously dated. His busy schedule jet setting all over the world was another cause of concern for her as she felt like she never got to see him. They ended their engagement in 2012 and as a parting gift, Simon bought her&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>a multimillion-dollar mansion</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>SIMON COWELL GOES UNDER THE KNIFE AGAIN AFTER ELECTRIC BIKE ACCIDENT</a></strong></p><p>We know Simon is a changed man now and being a father has certainly brought out a new side of him.
