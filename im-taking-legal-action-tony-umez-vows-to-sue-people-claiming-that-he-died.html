I need to address this disturbing issue that has come to my attention. There are some unscrupulous individuals who have been using my pictures and videos maliciously, falsely reporting me as deceased in order to gain traffic to their pages. First and foremost, I want to assure you that I am very much alive and well. These false reports are nothing, but baseless rumours spread by individuals with ill intentions. I will be taking legal action against these persons, as their actions not only infringe upon my rights but also cause unnecessary distress to my loved ones and fans."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8c7530a7-9f28-4f14-8b7e-408288d974ad data-caption="When the fake news spread on social media, the actor's fans were heartbroken"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/-PNktkpTURBXy8zYmRjMDdmZmY1ZGFkZmJhZTJjYmM4NzRhMWYwZTVlYS5wbmeRlQLNAdvNAWPCww></span> <span class=caption>When the fake news spread on social media, the actor's fans were heartbroken</span> <span class=copyright>ece-auto-gen</span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Going on, Umez advised the public to be wary of those who misuse the power of information to spread fake news.
