The Monterey County venue was a fusion of regal and rustic, the perfect vibe for the couple’s extraordinary day.</p><p>“We’re in a redwood forest, but we got married right in front of this mother tree that’s surrounded by all these smaller trees,” Erbert <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “They drop all the seeds, and it plants kind of like an army of children to protect the mother. The symbolism of it was beautiful. We’re here, planting our seeds to grow our family.”</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> judge, their wedding felt like a fairytale happening in “one of the most breathtaking places.” During their nuptials, the two exchanged both personal and traditional vows, with Hough’s brother-in-law as the officiating official.</p><p>Celebrity guests included Hough’s sister Julianne Hough and her co-host Alfonso Ribeiro, fellow dance pros and married couple Val Chmerkovskiy and Jenna Johnson.

Thus, for their honeymoon, Hough and Erbert decided to go to Italy.</p><p>“We’ve never been. I mean, I’ve been for a competition, but that was it. We’ve never experienced it properly. So it’s really great because it’s a place that we’re going to be able to experience together for the first time,” Hough said.</p><p>According to Hough, they will be hitting everywhere from Lake Como, Positano, Amalfi Coast, Rome, Tuscany, and Florence.</p><p>The couple went public with their relationship in 2017.
