After a super close competition, only four queens remain on the path for a spot in the Drag Race Hall of Fame. Here’s what you should know about finalist Kylie Sonique Love.</strong></p><p>Kylie got her spot on All Stars after competing on the second and sixth seasons of Drag Race. As some might remember from her <a href=#>maxi-challenge monologue</a>, she was thrown into the military when she was younger because she was “too feminine” and soon after found drag as a way to celebrate herself. What else is there to know about this drag queen?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-she-is-the-first-contestant-on-rupaul-s-drag-race-to-come-out-as-a-trans-woman>1. She is the First Contestant On ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ to Come Out As A Trans Woman</h2><p>During the season two reunion of RuPaul’s Drag Race, Kylie came out as transgender on live television. She <a href=#>talked about</a> how she’s always been a girl trapped in a boy’s body and has been happier since taking testosterone blockers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-she-is-miley-cyrus-s-drag-mother>2. She is Miley Cyrus’s Drag Mother</h2><p>The two are seen in an adorable Instagram video where Cyrus asks Kylie to be her drag mother last June. For those who don’t know, this means that Kylie will now act as a mentor to Cyrus on her drag journey.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CQl_d6wh4ti/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-kylie-sonique-love-s-drag-mother-is-the-goddess-raven>3. Kylie Sonique Love’s Drag Mother is The Goddess Raven</h2><p>This queen’s drag mother is now retired, but was known for being an Atlanta performer as well as a national pageant titleholder. This YouTube video posted by Love was published in 2009 and features The Goddess Raven performing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-she-got-a-rhinoplasty-and-breast-augmentation-in-2012>4. She Got a Rhinoplasty and Breast Augmentation In 2012</h2><p>Kylie shared her experiences with both surgeries on her <a href=#>YouTube channel</a>. May I just add, she looks absolutely stunning in this video, even without makeup. Although the video is labeled Day 14 Post-Surgery, she had no visible bruises. But, it seems like she didn’t end up loving the results down the line.</p><p>In 2019, she shared that she actually didn’t like her breast implants. She made sure to make it clear that she didn’t like the size of her breast implants, but would not be de-transitioning because of it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I hate having breast implants. It’s just not me,it never was. I was fine with my smaller breast before. I let opinions of others influence me into getting them. It doesn’t make me any more or less of the person I am. Yes, I still identify as a trans female just want smaller boobs</p>— Kylie Sonique Love (@xoSonique) <a href=#>April 26, 2019</a></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-she-didn-t-have-cable-growing-up>5. She Didn’t Have Cable Growing Up</h2><p>In a recent Instagram post, Kylie talked about her inspiration behind her “oops I did it again fashion fail” look in RuPaul’s Drag Race. In the post, she exposed that television was not a part of her childhood.</p><p>“I was born in 1983 I didn’t watch a lot of TV and movies growing up as a kid because we didn’t have cable like that, so everything that I did see really made an impression,” she wrote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CTFORZtPiuP/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Stay tuned for the next episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars next Thursday on Paramount+ to see how Kylie does in the remainder of the competition.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kim-K.jpeg alt="Kardashians’ Got Talent: How Many Shows Have the Reality Stars Competed On?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57lGaroaGenMBuxc6uZJ2hlKPBbrfNqK5mmZKkwrV5yrKjop1dqLyvtdCunGakn6uybrvFZqmuqJGqubR5w6uYoGWilrCmecClo2arpJa%2FtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
