They include Matthew 20: 1–16.</p><p>Verse 6 -7 reads, “And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day?’ They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.’</p><p>In Verse 9, the last minute people got paid the same amount as the early workers. Hence, the 11th-hour miracle theory.</p><p>Biblical figures believed to have enjoyed last minute blessings include Abraham and Sarah in Gen 18:10–14, Zechariah and Elizabeth in Luke 1:5–13, The Thief at the Cross in Luke 23:33–43.</p><p>Target audience</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>These miracles are for people who feel like they lost their opportunity, suffered a delay in life, and tired.</p><p>Basically, anyone who has been calling on God on year without seeing fruits qualifies for this kind of miracle.</p><p>The danger of 11th-hour miracles</p><p>There is nothing wrong with hanging on to your faith and refusing to lose hope even as ‘time runs out.’</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Still, there is always a danger with humans of idolizing things like this. With taglines like this, it can be easy to chase/worship the miracles rather than focusing on the person responsible for these works.</p><p>In order not to fall for this temptation, we need to remember that God works all through the year. He is not bound by time neither is He waiting until the last minute for you to enjoy His blessings.</p><p>Hence, it is important that we do not lose sight of this as we begin to see all the 11th-hour miracles ads because He is not limited to the last minute.</p><p>Remember, God works all year long, not just during the 11th hour.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwvsSloKChn6N8ra3SrWSmoZ6qwaZ5zKKpmpucmsBus9SyqmasmJp6prjEr5ynrJhitbDB0WagrGWlpbyvedSsZrCiaanGcYE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
