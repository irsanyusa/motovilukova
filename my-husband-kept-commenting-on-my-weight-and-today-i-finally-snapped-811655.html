In&nbsp;a&nbsp;personal post, a&nbsp;woman shares her experience with being criticized by&nbsp;her own husband, despite their efforts to&nbsp;address the issue. After reaching a&nbsp;breaking point, she confronted her husband, resulting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful and transformative moment.</p><p><h2>She took to&nbsp;the internet to&nbsp;discuss her husband’s behavior.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b9/521/53e83b5d1c981f67429fccc27c.jpg><p>The woman stated in&nbsp;her post that she had always been petite, at&nbsp;5"3 (1.60&nbsp;m) and weighing around 95&nbsp;lbs (around 43&nbsp;kg). Even after bringing a&nbsp;child into the world, her weight remained unchanged&nbsp;— that is&nbsp;until they moved to&nbsp;a&nbsp;cold country.</p><p>Suddenly stuck inside with nothing to&nbsp;do, the author <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found</a> herself munching on&nbsp;snacks and eating more than usual. But then a&nbsp;genius idea hit her: if&nbsp;she got a&nbsp;bit heavier, she could stay warm and save money on&nbsp;energy bills at&nbsp;the same time. And with that, the author embraced her newfound curvier figure, packing on&nbsp;4&nbsp;whole kilograms of&nbsp;extra padding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/272/9c3/56d1dc5067aad92269d3215cca.jpg><p>After being married for 8&nbsp;years and sharing the joy of&nbsp;raising an&nbsp;adorable 3-year-old, the woman found herself the target of&nbsp;body criticizing from an&nbsp;unlikely source: her own husband. Despite weathering the challenges of&nbsp;<a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> and emerging without any stretch marks, she was gaining weight. Instead of&nbsp;offering support, her husband made jokes and comments about her size, including a&nbsp;snarky remark about her clothing size.</p><p>“Well, you know&nbsp;I like them petite,” said the husband one day, and when they went shopping. Her husband also said things like, “You’re a&nbsp;size 6&nbsp;yeh? Or?”</p><p><h2>Things soon became heated.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bed/2b6/eabb0b5a54afc3a3a01ee34366.png><p>The woman’s usual laid-back attitude took a&nbsp;backseat when her husband suggested doing star jumps to&nbsp;keep warm. Seizing the opportunity to&nbsp;address the elephant in&nbsp;the room, she confronted her husband and asked if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was implying that she needed to&nbsp;exercise. The husband, ever nonchalant, laughed off the question and quipped that a&nbsp;little exercise “wouldn’t hurt.”</p><p>The woman had finally reached her breaking point and confronted her husband, albeit in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lighthearted manner. Referencing her husband’s preference for a&nbsp;petite figure, the author jokingly said: “Listen, I&nbsp;get it&nbsp;you like me&nbsp;petite, but&nbsp;I like Aleksander Skarsgård in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Northman</i></a>. Are you gonna sort yourself out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;like him?” The woman had always accepted her husband’s skinny frame, despite it&nbsp;not being her usual type.</p><p>After she jokingly suggested her husband transform into Alexander Skarsgård, the husband started doing push-ups, and she feared she might have to&nbsp;start exercising as&nbsp;well. Despite feeling upset and confused about the situation, the author realized <a href=#><strong>that the weight gain</strong></a>, which amounted to&nbsp;only 4-5&nbsp;kg, was a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;improved <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a>, particularly after a&nbsp;period of&nbsp;malnutrition and hospitalization.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6rLHPrWScp52isq%2FAyKeeZqeeYrq6edaeoKCgpGKur7CMraadmalitm6yyKeYpaSpYsCvrc%2BpnJ1laGZ%2Bd4GUaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
