From terms like “niner” to “Zulu,” pilot-speak can sound like its own language.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While most of the phrases flight crew use were borne out of a need for clear and succinct communication over an occasionally fuzzy radio transmission, according to aviation experts, there are also more colorful phrases that pilots say were conceived of in the sky and shared widely among staffers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“A lot of the ways we say things to be meaningful to other pilots is kind of monkey-see, monkey-do,” says Ferdi Mack, senior manager at the Pilot Information Center, of picking up lingo on the job. “Part of your challenge is to get it and understand it.” And flight crews often use the same pilot slang in slightly different ways.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More from TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So if you’ve ever wondered what your flight crew is talking about, you can save yourself years of aviation training with this rundown of pilot jargon.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“Let’s kick the tires and light the fires”</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Famously <a href=# rel=noopener>uttered by Harry Connick Jr. in <i>Independence Day</i></a>, the military phrase signals that a <a href=#>plane is just about ready for takeoff</a>, says Mark Baker, a commercial pilot of 35 years and current president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA). Once the crew completes the pre-flight gear inspection, it’s time to ignite the engine and take to the sky. These days however, it’s much more common to hear pilots announce that the plane is “cleared for takeoff” — particularly on commercial flights — for the sake of brevity.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“Feet wet”</b><br></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This phrase alerts air traffic controllers when a military aircraft, (usually a Navy carrier pilot), is flying over water, says Tom Haines, a private pilot and editor-in-chief of AOPA’s Pilot magazine. In the event that the aircraft encounters an emergency above water, like trouble in a combat zone, the controllers can deploy the proper rescue vessels given the plane’s location. Once a flight has crossed the shore and resumes flying over land, they’ll call in to air traffic control that they’re “feet dry,” Haines adds.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“We’ve got a deadhead crew flying to Chicago”</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite how it may sound, this isn’t an insult: Off-duty pilots or flight crew who board a commercial flight as passengers to fly back to the plane’s home base are called “deadheads,” Haines says. “Deadheading” is fairly common: if a flight crew lands in their destination but must depart from a different airport for their next shift, an airline can fly the off-duty crew members there, as long as there are seats available, he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In rare cases, a deadhead crew can boot paying passengers. United Airlines created a customer service frenzy when a viral video captured a passenger’s <a href=#>violent removal</a> from an overbooked flight to make room for four deadhead United crew members. Airport security officers dragged a bloodied David Dao down the aisle of the plane after he refused to give up his seat. Two security officers were fired after the incident, and United has since <a href=#>settled</a> with Dao.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“There’s a pilot in the jumpseat”</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If there aren’t any seats in the passenger cabin available for deadheads, they can claim an extra fold-up seat in the <a href=#>cockpit</a>, known as a “jumpseat.” Most jumpseats are reserved for FAA inspectors or off-duty flight personnel traveling back to their home base, says Ross Aimer, a retired United Airlines pilot of 40 years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You basically beg for a ride on your airline or somebody’s else’s to get to work,” Aimer says. Several airlines offer courtesy jumpseats to pilots from other companies, too.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“It’s 17:00 Zulu time”</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since <a href=#>pilots</a> can pass through multiple time zones in one trip and must communicate with air traffic controllers from around the world, aviators follow “Zulu time,” or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), the universal time zone of the skies, Aimer says. GMT is the time kept by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London. So if it’s 2 a.m. in London for example, it’ll be 02:00 “Zulu time” for every pilot in the air.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But to avoid confusion among passengers, pilots refer to the time zone of their destination when speaking with passengers over the intercom.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“George is flying the plane now”</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s a “George” on nearly every commercial aircraft, but he’s not a crew member. “George” is a nickname for a plane’s autopilot system that follows a programmed set of points to the flight’s destination, taking into consideration changes in turbulence and altitude, according to Aimer. Pilots often deploy George to command the plane when it reaches cruising altitude or when they’ve flown for more than 10 hours, when they’re required to rest per <a href=# rel=noopener>FAA regulations</a> for two-pilot planes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Get the latest career, relationship and wellness advice to enrich your life: sign up for TIME’s Living newsletter.</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“We’re flying through an air pocket”</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Turbulence-averse flyers, beware: “air pocket” is just another word for the winds that jostle a plane from different directions. Aimer says the term “air pocket” causes less <a href=#>panic</a> than “<a href=#>turbulence</a>” among passengers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“As soon as we say ‘turbulence,’ people get scared,” Aimer says. “We use ‘air pockets’ to calm [passengers] down.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The direction and force of winds often alter the length of a trip, too, depending on their direction: if the plane is flying with a strong wind, it may land 30 minutes to an hour earlier, Aimer says, depending on the length of their trip. If it’s flying against the wind, passengers might be in for a longer flight.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“Tree,” “fife” and “niner”</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Aviators often speak “pilot English” to avoid miscommunications over radio transmission. “Tree” for instance, means three, “fife” is the number five and “niner” means nine, says Tom Zecha, a manager at AOPA. The variations stemmed from a desire to avoid confusion between similar-sounding numbers, he says.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“Pass the crew juice”</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After a long day in the sky, <a href=#>crew members</a> often need to unwind—sometimes adjusting to a completely new time zone. “Juice” refers to a cocktail that former American Airlines flight attendant and aviation cabin safety expert Kathy Lord-Jones describes as a “mixture of [alcoholic] beverages” left over from a flight. Crew members are prohibited from drinking on the job; rather, they share the “juice” at the end of their “duty day,” or the full shift that starts with sign-in at the airport and ends with check-in at their hotel, Lord-Jones says.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“Pan-Pan”</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Airline <a href=#>passengers</a> likely won’t ever hear their pilot use this term, which is reserved for communication with air traffic controllers. When pilots notice something unusual with their aircraft that stops short of an immediate emergency, they use “pan-pan,” a signal of urgency and attention, Baker says. If one of a multi-engine aircraft’s engines has failed, for example, pilots might say “pan-pan” to get controllers’ attention and request an emergency landing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When pilots use this signal, other aviators on the same radio frequency will typically “shut up and let you get your message across,” Baker says, allowing air traffic control to provide the appropriate aid and prevent a crisis in flight.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>“There are 155 souls on board”</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The number of “souls” on an aircraft refers to the total living bodies on the plane: every <a href=#>passenger</a>, pilot, flight attendant and crew member, according to Lord-Jones. Pilots often report the number of “souls” when declaring an emergency, she says, so rescuers know the amount of <a href=#>people</a> to search for.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Correction: <i>The original version of this story misdescribed the meanings behind some aviation phrases. </i>Zulu time is a 24-hour time system, not a 12-hour time system. “Souls on board” refers to all living bodies on the plane, not just the passengers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWNtfnWAjqmgpaekqHq0scKrnK1lnJa7qMHAoJxmpZWWu6q6xmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
