It takes time," added Sabetto.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>One reason is that "Japanese are very protective of their privacy."</p><p>The culture of sharing is not ingrained in society and -- in the case of Airbnb -- they do not like the noise and security risk caused by a procession of tourists in their backyard, he said.</p><p>In addition, unlike in many developed economies, the quality of service provision is very high in Japan. Hailing a taxi in a major city rarely takes more than a few seconds, lowering demand for Uber-type services.</p><p>Craftsmanship</p><p>Despite this bleak picture, there are some successes, notes<strong> Sabetto, </strong>with younger generations showing "a greater interest" in the sharing economy.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Car- and bike-sharing schemes are taking off and meal delivery service<strong> UberEATS </strong>has been a hit in Tokyo since arriving in 2016.</p><p>But local start-ups struggle to get financing, Sabetto said, in a country that tends to pride <strong>"monozukuri" </strong>-- or craftsmanship -- above innovation.</p><p>Some firms are moving away from the cities into the countryside, where a steady trend of depopulation has made sharing economy services more attractive.</p><p>Uber last month said it would launch a pilot programme this summer to hook up tourists and residents with available drivers in the western Awaji island.</p><p>But Sabetto said a change in culture was needed for the sharing economy to really take root.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I would like foreigners that are aware of the sharing economy to make their voice heard more to change the situation," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXy1scKhZJqhope7o3nUm5yrZaeksrR50qGmsGWalr2iuoydpp6rXaO8tXnSoZirnV2arrS1y7JmrG%2BaaoOoww%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
