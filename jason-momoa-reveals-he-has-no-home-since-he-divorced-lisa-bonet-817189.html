He&nbsp;left the home he&nbsp;shared with his ex&nbsp;and moved into a&nbsp;van. His new humble way of&nbsp;living has surprised many, but he&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;it, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;proudly gives fans sneak peeks into his “van life” on&nbsp;social media.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;tough divorce</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05c/443/fd68c15d79aad5b0f1516a3d51.jpg><p>Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet were once a&nbsp;beloved couple in&nbsp;Hollywood, captivating fans with their enigmatic relationship. They were known for keeping their <a href=# title=romance data-link=tag>romance</a> out of&nbsp;the public eye, leaving their admirers curious about the intriguing details of&nbsp;their love story.</p><p>The star of&nbsp;<i>Aquaman </i>confessed that he&nbsp;had first laid eyes on&nbsp;Bonet while watching her on&nbsp;television, instantly turning to&nbsp;his mother and proclaiming, “Mommy, I&nbsp;want that one.” From that instant, Momoa was resolute in&nbsp;his pursuit of&nbsp;Bonet.</p><p>And it&nbsp;actually happened when their paths crossed through mutual acquaintances at&nbsp;a&nbsp;jazz club. Describing the moment vividly, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>, “I&nbsp;literally turned around, and&nbsp;I see her, and she goes, ya&nbsp;know, ’I’m Lisa.’ I&nbsp;turned around to&nbsp;my&nbsp;friend, and&nbsp;I was like, ’Ahhh!’ I&nbsp;had fireworks going off inside, man.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/154/088/5ddbff547d975490356d97dc86.jpg><p>From that moment&nbsp;on, they went on&nbsp;their first date, and not after a&nbsp;long time they decided to&nbsp;tie the knot. The couple also grew a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> welcoming their two kids, with Momoa willingly assuming the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving stepfather to&nbsp;Zoë Kravitz, Bonet’s daughter from a&nbsp;previous relationship.</p><p>In&nbsp;January <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2022</a>, Momoa and Bonet announced their split after 16&nbsp;years together, including almost five years of&nbsp;marriage. They acknowledged their growth and differences, with Momoa loving travel and adventure while Bonet preferred cozy activities like reading, writing, and cooking. Yet, they remain committed to&nbsp;their children and believe their love will continue to&nbsp;flourish.</p><p><h2>Jason embraced the van life after their split</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/636/695/5f26ba5fb7a4b7dff7f3fcd6eb.jpg><p>After their divorce announcement, Jason Momoa was sometimes spotted living in&nbsp;his camper van, parked at&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend’s house in&nbsp;Los Angeles. What’s interesting is&nbsp;that this $750,000 Ford RV&nbsp;is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;few miles away from the home where Momoa and Bonet used to&nbsp;live with their children.</p><p>This vehicle has occasionally served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;substitute for a&nbsp;hotel during his filming ventures away from home. According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>source</a>, Momoa often chooses to&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;his van instead of&nbsp;staying in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hotel on&nbsp;set, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;prefers being close to&nbsp;the beach. It’s no&nbsp;secret that the actor is&nbsp;not one for lavish private jets or&nbsp;luxury resorts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39c/620/03a939529a86fee73cc0768286.jpg><p>Momoa has always had a&nbsp;taste for the nomadic life. He’s not just an&nbsp;adventurer on&nbsp;the big screen.</p><p>Back in&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pre-fame</a> days, he&nbsp;and a&nbsp;buddy went on&nbsp;an&nbsp;epic escapade. Broke as&nbsp;can&nbsp;be, they hopped in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small van and explored the jaw-dropping landscapes of&nbsp;Ireland. No&nbsp;fancy plane tickets for them&nbsp;— they fully embraced the nomadic lifestyle. These stories really capture Momoa’s easygoing and carefree approach to&nbsp;life that is&nbsp;still going on&nbsp;today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e1/c73/974ae4595388026416c58c07bf.jpg><p>Recently, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;Instagram <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a>, Momoa gave his followers a&nbsp;little peek into his van life. He&nbsp;showed off how his van was decked out with everything he&nbsp;needed. But what’s really cool is&nbsp;how he’s all about being eco-friendly. He&nbsp;ditched the plastic and showed off his plastic-free products.</p><p>He&nbsp;also went the extra mile and showed himself taking a&nbsp;speedy shower using a&nbsp;hanging shower head on&nbsp;the van’s door. As&nbsp;if&nbsp;that wasn’t enough, Momoa made sure his van life was super convenient by&nbsp;parking it&nbsp;right outside a&nbsp;superstore. It’s clear that practicality is&nbsp;the key to&nbsp;his hassle-free life on&nbsp;the road.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Watch the actor show his morning routine in&nbsp;the van.</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLeiv86nZKannaSubr7Er5yapKNitaZ5x5qqZqafYrWwucRmqqKmk5p6qbGMnaCvp6KYsqV5y6KqmmWSpLumwIxxaHBpaG58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
