If the number continues to grow this year too, we will be able to plant a few hectares of a new forest,” says Adam Soustružník, Spokesman for the university. The university will plant the trees in cooperation with Lesy ČR, a company established by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic which manages the state-owned forest estates.</p><p>The university and its partner aim to plant the trees at locations where they are needed the most. The tree planting is only one part of the campaign which has a deep meaning and aims to show how we can contribute to the future of our society, not only our own. The university sees its students as the future leaders and experts who can positively impact the world.</p><p>“The generation of young people begins to be very active, they literally want to change the world. And we encourage them to start right now – by choosing the right major, in which they want to become an expert in, so that they can really contribute to the improvement of that field and not only talk about needed changes. Whether it is the environment, society, education, technology, medicine or arts,” explains Soustružník.</p><p>Apart from planting trees, University of Ostrava has been running long-term projects to support blood and bone marrow donations, organizes discussions with scientists to talk important topics and conducts research to solve various problems, for example in the fields of social work, ecology, urbanism or human health. “University of Ostrava is looking for enthusiastic students who want to change the world to take part not only in our study programmes but also in these projects with real impact on the outside,” adds the Spokesman for the university.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMbEnJ%2BuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtemLyue8Crq6KbnJp8trrIr5yrq5mpxm67xWamrKyilsOiedaio6VloKGur8CMmmStqpWaeqe70Wacr52irnq0wNSdnKesXZa9sbjInJitoZ%2BjerOxwp6gr52U</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
