So after I traced the former boyfriend guy, I was able to meet him, crush his phone, crush it everywhere, get the videos, and then I left."</p><p>“This is my fiancee, and this is someone I was supposed to be getting married to in February. So on getting home, I asked her, demanding the truth, but she still wanted to deny it till I showed her the video. So she still denied it, then I got angry and slapped her and she used the opportunity to run from the house.”</p><p>Explaining why he withheld her passport, Wade said he did not want Empress to flee the country because she owed him money.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>On January 2…Wade releases Njamah’s nude videos, says he misses her though</h3></p><p>Wade's internet release of Njamah's private videos, including benign ones of her taking a bath, quickly gained notoriety.

I swear to God, I just miss you. Seriously, I just miss you. That’s the real truth; that’s no joke. But please, stop telling people that I can’t travel. Don’t do that, I beg you, please,” Wade said in the video.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-22>Njamah’s reaction to the leak</h3></p><p>In her first comment since the news of her leaked nude video broke, Njamah said in response to the leaked videos that she is alive and OK.</p><p>She said, "love you guys, I’m good, Thank you, guys, for all the love, support, messages and visits.
