But that doesn’t mean that actors don’t have real lives behind the scenes. Sometimes, actresses decide to&nbsp;become mothers and already have contracts with production companies. This presents a&nbsp;challenge for them, because of&nbsp;their <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a>, and for the filmmakers who have to&nbsp;decide whether to&nbsp;incorporate the belly into the plot or&nbsp;simply let the actress cover her belly.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>made a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;11&nbsp;celebrities who played during pregnancy (some of&nbsp;them had to&nbsp;hide their belly) and is&nbsp;revealing what these kids that made things complicated for their mothers and producers look like today.</p><p><h2>1. Julia Louis-Dreyfus in&nbsp;<i>Seinfeld</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a5/254/98c28f537bb9f1e86f2e6ca67e.jpg><p>During the shooting of&nbsp;the third season of&nbsp;the popular sitcom, <i>Seinfeld</i>, Julia Louis-Dreyfus became <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pregnant</a> with her first child, Henry Hall. Baby Henry was born in&nbsp;July of&nbsp;1992. However, the actress’s pregnancy was never really a&nbsp;problem for the producers of&nbsp;the series. The simple solution writers came up&nbsp;with was to&nbsp;put her character, Elaine, in&nbsp;baggy clothes and any large garments to&nbsp;hide her belly. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Henry</a> is&nbsp;currently 29&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>2. Claire Danes in&nbsp;<i>Homeland</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/538/e67/2ed6c65406816056e31127d335.jpg><p>You probably know actress Claire Danes because of&nbsp;the amazing performance she delivered as&nbsp;the CIA agent, Carrie Mathison, in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=television data-link=tag>television</a> series, <i>Homeland</i>. However, what’s not often talked about is&nbsp;the fact that she was 8&nbsp;months <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pregnant</a> when she completed the filming of&nbsp;the second season. Her pregnancy could not be&nbsp;introduced in&nbsp;the plot due to&nbsp;her character, so&nbsp;they decided to&nbsp;use digital retouching to&nbsp;hide her belly. Her son, Cyrus, was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>born</a> in&nbsp;December 2012, and he’s now 9&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>3. Ellen Pompeo in&nbsp;<i>Grey’s Anatomy</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f9b/f74/210d165d03b96be8f7d59bd4a8.jpg><p>During the filming of&nbsp;the sixth season of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most popular drama series ever created, <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i>, producers decided to&nbsp;hide Ellen Pompeo’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pregnancy</a> from the cameras. This was done because, for the writers, this was not the right time for her character, Dr. Meredith, to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;baby, and they wanted to&nbsp;keep that for a&nbsp;later moment. In&nbsp;September 2009, Stella Luna, now 12&nbsp;years old, was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>born</a>.</p><p><h2>4. Zooey Deschanel in&nbsp;<i>New Girl</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/492/0cb/6ef34d56ec8a05a58ec2eb0481.jpg><p>Zooey Deschanel <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>was</a> 7&nbsp;months pregnant when season 5&nbsp;of&nbsp;the hit series, <i>New Girl</i>,<i> </i>was shot. As&nbsp;you probably remember, the actress had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;momentarily replaced by&nbsp;Megan Fox since producers were only able to&nbsp;hide her belly for no&nbsp;more than a&nbsp;few episodes. Deschanel also had to&nbsp;stay off the series until she returned from postpartum rest. Zooey gave <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>birth</a> to&nbsp;her daughter, Elsie, in&nbsp;August 2015, and today the little girl is&nbsp;5&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>5. Holly Marie Combs in&nbsp;<i>Charmed</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d9d/17c/26bee457f4803a48dcbcf5b8c8.jpg><p>Holly Marie Combs, who plays Piper, one of&nbsp;the main characters of&nbsp;the series, <i>Charmed</i>, announced during the shooting of&nbsp;the sixth season that she was pregnant. The producers thought it&nbsp;was better to&nbsp;hide her <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pregnancy</a> at&nbsp;first. However, after a&nbsp;while, they decided that it&nbsp;was better for her character to&nbsp;actually have a&nbsp;child in&nbsp;the story as&nbsp;well. Apparently, Piper’s pregnancy was planned before the actress knew she was expecting a&nbsp;baby, so&nbsp;that came in&nbsp;handy. Combs <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>gave birth</a> to&nbsp;her first child, Finley Arthur, in&nbsp;2004, and he’s now 17&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>6. Amaia Salamanca in&nbsp;<i>Velvet</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/30a/b8d/68c36f5135b4d3b05f420a8b5c.jpg><p>Amaia Salamanca’s pregnancy was well-planned when she rejoined the set of&nbsp;<i>Velvet</i>, a&nbsp;show about the compelling Spanish story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fashion house in&nbsp;Madrid in&nbsp;the late ’50s. Because of&nbsp;this, production had no&nbsp;choice but to&nbsp;make Barbara, her character, pregnant as&nbsp;well. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;28, she gave birth to&nbsp;her first child, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>girl</a> named Olivia Varo, in&nbsp;April 2014.</p><p><h2>7. Kerry Washington in&nbsp;<i>Scandal</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/354/745/34efe95df9985d37fda866c200.jpg><p>Kerry Washington’s pregnancy happened right in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the shooting of&nbsp;the series, <i>Scandal</i>, in&nbsp;which she played the main character. This unforeseen event forced producers to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>reduce</a> the number of&nbsp;episodes to&nbsp;hide the actress’s pregnancy that couldn’t fit the schedule of&nbsp;the series. Currently, her <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>daughter</a>, Isabelle, is&nbsp;7&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>8. Kristen Bell in&nbsp;<i>House of&nbsp;Lies</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d77/44d/1e1845544293f1814be6d703ea.jpg><p>The star of&nbsp;the <i>House of&nbsp;Lies</i> TV&nbsp;series, <a href=# title="Kristen Bell" data-link=tag>Kristen Bell</a>, was about 6&nbsp;months <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pregnant</a> with her first daughter when the second season of&nbsp;the show was about to&nbsp;be&nbsp;shot. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;actually film some episodes, the producers had to&nbsp;hire a&nbsp;body double for the scenes in&nbsp;which Bell would have had to&nbsp;show her belly. Her first <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>daughter</a>, Lincoln Bell, is&nbsp;now 8&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>9. Cobie Smulders in&nbsp;<i>How I&nbsp;Met Your Mother</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/49e/71d/97b57d51f49f3b344e0a84115c.jpg><p>Actress Cobie Smulders brought her character, Robin, to&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;small screens thanks to&nbsp;the sitcom, <i>How I&nbsp;Met Your Mother</i>. After fellow actress Alyson Hannigan told the show-runners that she was pregnant, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Cobie Smulders</a> discovered that she was also pregnant and told the producers who had to&nbsp;camouflage both of&nbsp;their pregnancies. To&nbsp;disguise Smulders’ belly, producers asked the costume designers to&nbsp;use garments and objects that could hide her abdomen, and they had the character remain seated for most of&nbsp;the scenes that she appeared&nbsp;in. In&nbsp;May 2009, the actress gave <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>birth</a> to&nbsp;her daughter, Shaelyn.</p><p><h2>10. Madonna in&nbsp;<i>Evita</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f93/38d/c8d9485bdebadd884d2d7b4dd4.jpg><p>Madonna, also known as&nbsp;the Queen of&nbsp;Pop, made the controversial 1996 film in&nbsp;which she played the wife of&nbsp;Argentinian dictator Juan Domingo Perón, Eva Perón. However, Madonna was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pregnant</a> with her daughter, Lourdes Leon, back then. It&nbsp;was because of&nbsp;this that the crew of&nbsp;Evita cleverly used costumes and camera shots so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;was not noticeable that Madonna was <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pregnant</a> with her eldest daughter who is&nbsp;now 24&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>11. Lisa Kudrow in&nbsp;<i>Friends</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ed/178/4bbce95e7883ca019b3aac7628.jpg><p>When Lisa Kudrow played Phoebe Buffay on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most famous sitcoms, <i>Friends</i>, she became <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>pregnant</a>. This was right about when they started filming the fourth season. The producers decided to&nbsp;include her pregnancy in&nbsp;the story by&nbsp;having Phoebe lend her womb to&nbsp;her brother to&nbsp;conceive triplets because he&nbsp;and his wife couldn’t have kids on&nbsp;their own. Today, her only son, Julian, is&nbsp;23&nbsp;years old.</p><p>What is&nbsp;your favorite family series?
