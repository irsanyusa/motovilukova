He was born to a German-Swiss father and South African mother. At the time, such unions were not allowed because of the apartheid rule.</p><p class=align-left>To avoid being segregated by the regime, his parents were forced to hide their relationship. Most of Trevor’s jokes are centered on his experience growing up under the apartheid system.</p><p class=align-left>Noah developed an interest in comedy when he was in his 20s. His friends would dare him to get on stage whenever they went out. After doing it so often, his talent as a standup comedian blossomed.</p><p class=align-left>As a young comedian in a cross-cultural nation like South Africa, Trevor had one thing that many comics lack – the ability to speak several languages eloquently. That meant he could tailor the content of his comedy to suit a particular audience.</p><p class=align-left>In 2009, the black comedian shot his first-ever one-person documentary, <i>The Day Walker</i>.
