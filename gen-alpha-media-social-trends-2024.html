Gen Alpha was born into it, molded by it. Streaming video, playing video games or scrolling on social media is as natural to Alphas as breathing.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">New Morning Consult research on the generation —&nbsp;born 2013 and onwards — shows that digital activities make up the a big part of their daily routines, illustrated by the 51% of Gen Alpha parents who said their Alpha child streams content on a video service at least once a day, or the 54% who said they spend up to four hours on social media daily.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Because <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>device ownership among Gen Alpha kids</a> is high, consuming content and partaking in entertainment digitally is part and parcel to how many parents keep their children occupied, as working Americans are busier than they’ve ever been. This will undoubtedly be a major source of discovery as the youngest generation begins to learn about their likes and dislikes, but it will come with sensitive territory for companies to navigate.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Streaming video is the norm for Gen Alpha kids</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A plurality of Gen Alpha parents say that their youngest Gen Alpha child watches content on a video streaming service, followed by reading books and playing video games.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Our research groups children into ages 0-4, 5-7 and 8-10, and some media and entertainment related activities vary a lot by age group, given the legal requirements or complexity of the activity (such as using social media or playing video games). But others are more universal among the entire cohort, likely because there aren’t age restrictions to those activities, or they’re ones that parents can let their kids do independently, such as streaming video or listening to audio.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Among the platforms parents are most likely to say their kids use, YouTube, Disney+ and Netflix top the list, same as they did last year. YouTube remains a powerhouse of kid’s content, with some streamers <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>ceding their content</a> to the site in hopes of wider reach. And streaming services themselves have been investing heavily in building out their library of children’s content; a Disney executive told the Wall Street Journal that families with children churn slower than those without young ones.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">All that said, these mostly indoor pastimes make up a minority of what parents say their children are interested in doing: 36% said their Alphas want to spend their time indoors having screen time, compared with 55% of those who said the same about the outdoors. However, that gap starts to narrow as the kids age up, with the biggest change happening when children age out of the 5-7 group and into the 8-10 one.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Alpha’s social media habits are beginning to solidify</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Though social media doesn’t make the top three for the entire Gen Alpha group, it rises in importance for Alphas ages 8-10, right behind streaming video and playing video games.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Drilling down further, a majority of older Gen Alphas (65%) are spending up to 4 hours a day on social media —&nbsp;a higher share than younger Gen Zers who are doing the same (56%). Gen Z are, of course, are significantly more likely to spend <i>more</i> than 4 hours a day on social, but at least at the shallow end of the pool, older Gen Alphas are already catching up to Gen Z.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While social media platforms have a minimum age of 13 and the oldest Gen Alpha is just turning 11, it’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>widely documented</a> that kids will lie about their age to gain access to platforms, a problem that became the subject of a lawsuit 33 U.S. states filed against Meta late last year. They cited evidence that the tech giant knows about and <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>routinely ignores</a> reports about underage users. In 2021, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Instagram drew ire</a> after it was reported that it would build a version of its app just for children under the age of 13, which was then quickly scrapped.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Beyond children’s role in falsifying ages to get access to various platforms, some parents also play a big part in their young ones’ participation on social media. The rise of the “<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>kidfluencer</a>” means that even if the children are not the ones posting directly or engaging meaningfully with the content, they are still very much involved on the platforms in a secondary manner.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The war for Gen Alpha’s attention picks up</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">For now, Gen Alpha’s time spent consuming digital media is lower than it is for other generations just by the nature of how young they are, but as we’ve seen with Gen Z, this will begin increasing dramatically as they get older.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Our previous research on Gen Alpha</a> found that the generation is already often involved in household purchasing decisions, and that the young children are often getting ideas about new products and brands from the likes of haul videos and unboxing videos. Marketing to children is an extremely sensitive subject, but whether or not brands are actively doing so, young children are still being advertised to in some way, shape or form.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But as conversations around the negative impacts of media overconsumption continue, many industries will have to navigate a sensitive environment in which children’s digital privacy and mental health takes center stage.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><strong><i>Download our </i></strong><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#><strong><i>latest Gen Alpha report</i></strong></a><strong><i> to learn more about the youngest generation’s media and entertainment habits.</i></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX5yyr3nApaehmV2isqW1wGaqqJuZlrluwNGepZ2rXWd9c4A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
