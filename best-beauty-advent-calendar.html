We considered things like giftability, value of the products, overall design, and ease of ordering.</p><h2 id=what-you-should-know-before-buying-beauty-advent-calendars>What you should know before buying beauty Advent calendars</h2><h3>Number of days</h3><p>Some Advent calendars contain 24 (sometimes even 25) days (starting on December 1st), and others have only 12 days. It will depend on the brand or retailer and how they promote their products. For example, beauty Advent calendars with full-sized products may only contain 12 days.</p><h3>Delivery speed</h3><p>If you want to do the full 24 days, you’ll want to make sure the Advent calendar arrives before December 1.</p><h3>Types of beauty Advent calendars</h3><p>Most beauty Advent calendars will have a mix of full and trial-sized products for you to try out. With so many beauty brands on the Advent calendar bandwagon, you can likely find specialized calendars from particular brands or general ones full of a variety of products and makers. You can buy them directly from the brands, online shops, or look for them in department stores. There are endless combinations of beauty Advent calendars from skincare and makeup, to fragrances and lip gloss. The larger calendars usually contain an assortment of items, so you don’t end up with too many of one product.</p><h3>What’s inside</h3><p>Consider the products you like when looking for the best beauty Advent calendars. If you prefer perfume, you may want to stick with a calendar that will gift you sweet smells, whereas a makeup calendar could provide shimmer and shine for the holidays. If you plan to have guests, you could choose a beauty Advent calendar with mini soaps or hand creams and leave them out for your friends and family who come to stay.</p><h2 id=who-are-you-buying-for>Who are you buying for?</h2><p>You can find beauty Advent calendars for all different genders and ages.
