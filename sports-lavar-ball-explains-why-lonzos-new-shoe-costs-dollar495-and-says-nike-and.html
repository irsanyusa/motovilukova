In typical LaVar fashion, his answer was part confidence, part humor, part simplicity, and a whole lot of boisterous.</p><p>"I figured that's what the shoe was worth," Ball told Le Batard. "I liked the way it sounds. You see, when you are your own owner, you can come up with any price you want."</p><p>"Let Nike and Adidas and Under Armour — they battling below me," Ball said. "They'll go ahead and put all their stuff in Foot Locker. I'm better than them. I'm a step above."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>As for why the shoe was specifically priced at $495 and not, say, $500, Ball again acted like the question was a bit absurd.</p><p>"Five hundred dollars?! Four-ninety-five sounds better," Ball said. "I like three different digits."</p><p>Ball further defended the shoe's price by saying it was "symbolic" — Lonzo is the first basketball player to have a brand before entering the NBA. He also said there was some value in knowing that his son "designed all of it" and that other shoe companies don't allow rookies to do that.</p><p>Listen to Ball's comments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70qmmq6yjZMCxu9Gtqmakkauus3nBmqOlZZWtva2tyKeqZq%2BYrnqtu82zpqxlnprEbr%2FHqJxmm5%2BowbR5w6ijpZmiaYZ2ecCnm2arka7AbrrIpJxmmZ6ZfK7DlbFqbbA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
