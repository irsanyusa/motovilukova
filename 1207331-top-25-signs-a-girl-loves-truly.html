Here are the top 25 signs to tell if she loves you.</p><h3>1. She worries about you</h3><p class=align-left>One of the best signs a girl likes you is how she makes you her priority. She volunteers to help you out without or without you requesting her help. She cares about your well-being and hates seeing you sad or suffering.</p><h3>2. She makes sacrifices for you</h3><p class=align-left>You should sense a red flag when she drops everything and everyone for you. A girl who genuinely likes you will make sacrifices for you where possible and strike a balance between you and people/things that are important to her.</p><h3>3. You are her friend, and she tries to work on your relationship</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/15425c13fe724d0b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to start a conversation with a girl: Simple tips to get you started</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The girl will try to be your friend and let you know her family and friends. Ladies rarely open up to random people. Therefore, she trusts you if she is honest about her personal life and feels comfortable when you introduce each other to your family and friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e0fd25026f3d9dbf.jpg><h3>4. She loves your company</h3><p class=align-left>You will know she likes you if she tries to be around you. A woman interested in spending so much time with you wants to know more about you. Here are signs she likes your company:</p><ul><li>She invites you to events or activities that are important to her.</li><li>She honours your invitations to events or activities you would love her to be part of and will have a good reason if she fails to attend.</li><li>She is willing to spend a few more minutes or hours with you.</li><li>Her facial expressions show she is happy to be around you.</li><li>The girl allows herself and you to engage in silly childish things without feeling awkward.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2f67e6e919d0f2c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top flirty memes to send your partner when bored</span></p></a><h3>5. She tries to grab your attention when you are in a group of people</h3><p class=align-left>Notice if she is unusually loud when you are around other girls or people. She will also sit next to you or at your table during an event. If she is busy with other guests, she will find an excuse to talk to you several times to catch your attention.</p><h3>6. She is a good listener</h3><p class=align-left>A woman who has feelings for you will not <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">only listen </a>to your words but also keep them in her heart. She wants to know more about your values, perceptions about life, dreams and more. Therefore, she will be keen when you are talking to her.</p><h3>7. She makes an effort to keep the conversation going</h3><p class=align-left>She responds to your normal and <a href=#>romantic text messages</a> and answers your calls. A lady who likes you gets back to you as soon as possible when she is too busy to text you or misses your calls.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a5b1250c090bf4e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wondering what boys want in girls?

She knows your little inside jokes</h3><p class=align-left>If a woman understands your <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inside jokes</a>, she genuinely feels a connection with you. An inside or private joke is a sense of unique sense of humour. It is understandable only to people with a common and close connection, e.g. family, friends, couples, colleagues, and classmates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/15425c13fe724d0b.jpg><h3>9. She takes note of phrases you like using</h3><p class=align-left>One of the psychological signs a girl likes you more than a friend is her repeating phrases you like using intentionally or subconsciously. She might use these phrases to tease you, or the words might slip out of her mouth.</p><h3>10. She maintains eye contact</h3><p class=align-left>Notice how the lady moves her eyes when talking to you. She will drop everything she is doing and maintain <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">eye contact</a> when the two of you get into a deep and emotional conversation. However, the shy ones might avoid looking into your eyes and turn their faces away from you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2c6fb792015569f9.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top tips on how to tell if a girl likes you</span></p></a><h3>11. She compliments you and makes you feel good</h3><p class=align-left>One of the greatest signs that a girl loves you is when <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she compliments </a>your new attires, hairstyle, etc., and tells you how good they look on you. Some will even take note of your weight gain and loss.</p><h3>12. She tries to impress you</h3><p class=align-left>The girl will try to catch your attention because she wants you to notice her. A woman knows you have options and will try to show you that she is the best of all women you like or like you.

She acts nervous but in a good way</h3><p class=align-left>Your attention makes her nervous and a little shy. She wants to impress, entice, and get closer to you, but she is unsure how to do it. She worries she will mess it up, which makes her a little nervous. These signs will tell you that the girl in front of you is nervous:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/37833343c6f7bd31.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to propose a girl romantically</span></p></a><ul><li>She laughs at your jokes, including dry ones.</li><li>She subconsciously covers her eyes with her hands when you make eye contact.</li><li>She plays with her hair.</li><li>She looks down or turns her face so you can only see her cheek.</li><li>She fumbles with her hands.</li><li>She's talking fast or too much or not at all.</li></ul><h3>15. She draws attention to her neck and shoulders</h3><p class=align-left>The other way to tell if a girl is into you is to notice how she draws attention to her curves and other attractive physical features. For example, when a lady is constantly twirling a strand of hair or playing with a necklace, it could be a way of subconsciously displaying that she feels comfortable in your presence. Once you understand how to tell if a girl loves you, it is easy for you to <a href=#>win her heart</a>.</p><h3>16. She teases you, and it feels good</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d0ff6b11d006a9f2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best and amazing tips on how to impress a girl</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Jokes</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">teasing strengthen </a>human bonds; there is usually something more to it if it comes from a lady. A woman is only playfully throwing you off your game a little to see your comeback. She wants your attention, and there is a good chance you might draw closer than before.</p><h3>17. She has a strong desire to meet and chat with you</h3><p class=align-left>You should pay attention to those <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1236495-120-love-message-wife-ideas-heart.html href=#>beautiful flirty messages</a> you send each other because she might drop hints of wanting to meet you. A woman in love will be looking for an opportunity to meet and communicate with the guy she likes. She might invite you to an upcoming event or request you to accompany you to your next event.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2f67e6e919d0f2c9.jpg><h3>18. She has excessive joy, inspiration, and energy</h3><p class=align-left>If a girl gets excited and makes you happy, try to find out if she is genuinely in love with you before expressing your feelings. Your intuition will help you notice the positive or negative energy she radiates into your soul. Here are signs to know she sends positive energy to you:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6987260bd8a31e42.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top things to talk about with a girl you like</span></p></a><ul><li>She is your biggest cheerleader.</li><li>She shows gratitude and appreciation for the little things you do for her.</li><li>She inspires you to be a better person for yourself and the people you care about.</li><li>She has good pieces of advice about your plans.</li><li>Your meetings leave you in a good mood, and you want more.</li></ul><h3>19. She remembers the things you tell her</h3><p class=align-left>A lady who has feelings for you will remember things you talk about. Be patient and do not expect her to know or remember most things in a short time. Some of these signs will tell you that the girl remembers the things you tell her:</p><ul><li>She remembers your name.</li><li>She knows your birthday.</li><li>She remembers your favourite destinations.</li><li>She understands little things you would not like her to do to you.</li><li>She knows the little things she can do to make you happy.</li><li>She will also be mindful of your important work or school assignment deadlines.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/133d7e0a502752d7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to kiss a girl for the very first time: useful tips</span></p></a><h3>20. She asks you a lot of questions about yourself</h3><p class=align-left>If a woman asks you <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">personal questions,</a> she wants to know you better. She will, therefore, try to find out the tiniest details about your life, your family, and everything of great importance to you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a5b1250c090bf4e4.jpg><h3>21. She displays hints of jealousy</h3><p class=align-left>Jealousy is one of the early signs a girl likes you. A lady who is into you will always want your attention. Therefore, she will be sad when another woman receives most of your attention. Here are signs of a girl <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">who is jealous </a>because she likes you:</p><ul><li>She observes how you interact with other girls to determine if you like them.</li><li>She assumes you are chatting with other women at night when she sees you online. The girl might go offline, start chatting with you to get your attention or mention that she was online late at night in your next conversation.</li><li>Pay attention to questions like "Who was she?", "What's going on between you and her?" and "What was she saying to you?" Such questions are clear signs she likes you.</li><li>She acts weird when you are around other girls, touching you or wanting all your concentration.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/996feeb3ab97f3ed.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to know if a girl loves you?

She tries to make you jealous</h3><p class=align-left>The girl might become overly friendly with other boys when you are around and gives you the cold shoulder when you try to talk with her. Girls mostly behave this way if they see you being too close to other females.</p><h3>23. She is open to the idea of a first date</h3><p class=align-left>Ask her out on a date via<a href=#> sweet romantic texts </a>and see her reaction. She might agree to it immediately or pretend to be busy and promise to get back to you. Be patient and hope she is only playing hard to get. Some ladies will reject your invitation because they want you to insist before they give in.</p><h3>24. She always makes time for you</h3><p class=align-left>If she loves <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spending time </a>with you, it is not that she is free all the time. It is because it is a sacrifice she has made to be with their favourite person, and she is happy to create time for you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8b54d3fc0b5ab543.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>These signs she loves you without saying it out loud will blow your mind!</span></p></a><h3>25.
