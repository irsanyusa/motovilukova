The Spider-Man: No Way Home star has recently debunked the speculations after Zendaya suddenly unfollowed everyone on Instagram.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-zendaya-unfollowed-everyone-on-instagram-including-boyfriend-tom-holland>Zendaya Unfollowed Everyone on Instagram, Including Boyfriend Tom Holland</h2><p>On January 3, fans expressed alarm after they saw that the Euphoria star was following no one on Instagram. Zendaya used to follow her friends, co-workers, and boyfriend.</p><p>Upon learning about her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unfollow spree</a>, several fans began speculating about Zendaya and Holland’s potential breakup. They also pointed out that the two haven’t been spotted together since October 25 when they were seen grocery shopping in Los Angeles.</p><p>Despite assumptions, there were also confident others who think that Zendaya made the move to promote her upcoming movie, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Challengers</a>. The actress hasn’t given any explanation for cleaning her Instagram following until now, but she did post a Challengers movie poster most recently.</p><p>“Challengers April 26th,” she wrote. “Wishing you all the most beautiful new year.”</p><p>It pays noting that celebrities having zero following on Instagram is not an odd move. A-list stars like Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, Beyonce, Adele, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billie Eilish</a> all don’t follow anyone on the platform as well.</p><p>During her cover interview for Elle’s September 2023 issue, Zendaya shared what she thinks about revealing her romance with Holland to the public. According to the actress, she still has control over what she chooses to share about them.</p><p>“Parts of my life, I accept, are going to be public,” Zendaya said. “I can’t not be a person and live my life and love the person I love… It’s about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist. You can’t hide. That’s not fun either. I am navigating it more than ever now.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-spider-man-actor-denies-breakup-rumors-two-reportedly-together-during-new-year-s-eve>The Spider-Man Actor Denies Breakup Rumors, Two Reportedly Together During New Year’s Eve</h2><p>As the breakup rumors swirl around on social media, Holland has finally decided to address the same. Last weekend when the actor was being followed by a TMZ photographer, Holland denied their split.</p><p>“No, absolutely not,” he said.</p><p>Furthermore, a source with direct knowledge about the couple reported that the two spent the New Year’s Eve together. Meanwhile, on Friday, Zendaya was seen doing errands with her brother Austin in LA.</p><p>On Wednesday, the two were seen out, but separately. Zendaya was spotted driving around Austin. On the other hand, Holland was seen arriving at West Hollywood solo.</p><p>With present details, it’s safe to assume that the two are still together. Indeed, just because the public hasn’t seen Zendaya and Holland together, doesn’t mean they’re not spending time together.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NUP_194863_00783.jpg alt="Ariana Grande’s Weapon-Wielding Stalker Who Broke Into Her Home Gets Convicted, Faces Years Imprisonment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>tom holland</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>zendaya</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK572Z6lnZmplnq1u8xmn6iknJa7pXnAq5xmq6Seua1506ienqyYmr9usMSsp6KslWK1pr6MrKydnJWjeqq60q2YoKqRonq2usWoo6Wnp2LAsb7EnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
