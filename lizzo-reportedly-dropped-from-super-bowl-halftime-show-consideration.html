The singer is also apparently out of the running to sing the national anthem.</p><p>Another source told the outlet that Lizzo’s team is “desperately trying to come up with a strategy to save her sinking ship,” adding that it’s “becoming more and more difficult with more people coming forth accusing her of extremely inappropriate acts.”</p><p>Lizzo <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is being sued</a> by three of her former backup dancers, who have accused the singer of sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment. She has also been accused of weight-shaming a dancer.</p><p>Attorneys representing the dancers recently revealed that six other people have submitted similar complaints against Lizzo. The singer’s dance team captain Shirlene Quigley is also named in the suit, which accuses them of creating a “sexually charged and uncomfortable” work environment.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BEYONCE OMITS SONG LYRIC MENTIONING LIZZO DURING RECENT CONCERT</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-singer-calls-the-allegations-outrageous>The Singer Calls the Allegations ‘Outrageous’</h2><p>Earlier this month, Lizzo <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">responded to the allegations</a> against her in a lengthy social media statement.
