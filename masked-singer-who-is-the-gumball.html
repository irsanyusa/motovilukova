We’ve already seen so much talent in Group A, and now we’re meeting Group B. The star of the show in this group has to be the Gumball, who seems like an early contender to win the Golden Mask.</p><p>Want to know who the celebrity is under the Gumball mask? Let’s go through all the clues we have so far and make our prediction, even though it’s likely he’ll be around for a while!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>The Gumball sings “If I Only Had a Heart” by Jack Haley and “Heartbeat Song” by Kelly Clarkson on The Masked Singer‘s Wizard of Oz Night</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 11</h2><p>The Gumball’s first performance leaked a day before The Wizard of Oz episode aired, and another preview briefly showed him singing “Carry On My Wayward Son” by Kansas.</p><p>Then when it came to clues, Gumball said that “like the Tin Man” he’s “a little rusty.” We saw a map of the American South with a heart over it. The Gumball talked about doing everything when he first started to try to find success. He’s seen playing drums and guitar, and mentioned “beatboxing on the corner” and performing at theme parks. He even won a competition once but was boo’ed off the stage! Other visual clues included a spider and a bubble with a horse and carriage in it.</p><p>After his performance, a Flying Monkey brought in a heart with a clock. The Gumball explained, he has the “heart of a superhero.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RITA ORA TO REPLACE NICOLE SCHERZINGER ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 11</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Gumball</h2><p>The guessing game has begun online and in the show! Panelists predicted he could be Chace Crawford from The Boys, Jamie Dornan, or Kevin Jonas.</p><p>Fans agree with the judges, that this person is giving boy band or maybe even Broadway vibes. Popular predictions include Skylar Astin from Pitch Perfect, Joey McIntyre or Jordan Knight from New Kids on the Block, Broadway’s Jeremy Jordan, or AJ McLean from The Backstreet Boys.</p><p>Some guesses, though, completely ignore these and go right for someone with a FOX connection and an incredible singing voice, like Pat Monahan from Train or Kevin McHale from Glee! People have even guessed that this could be Usher or Jason Derulo, though those ones are more of a stretch.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Gumball on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>Looking at all the clues and hearing that voice, the Gumball could only be one actor! And that is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-scott-porter>Scott Porter!</h3><p>And here are all the clues that point to him.</p><p>The Gumball might’ve said he’s “a little rusty” because he hasn’t sung professionally or publicy in a while. The map we saw of the American South with a heart over it is a nod to his role in the TV show Hart of Dixie. When the Gumball mentioned performing at theme parks, that’s something Scott has talked about doing at <a href=#>theme parks in Orlando</a>.</p><p>The drums and guitar could be referring to the band he used to have, which just so happened to win a local competition called Star Search. It’s reasonable to assume this is the competition stage he talked about getting boo’ed off of after winning! Scott is also a beatboxer, so that clue makes sense. The spider and horse and carriage could both be alluding to his voice acting, for Spider-Man TV shows and for the God of War video game. His voice acting would also explain the “heart of a superhero” clue, because Scott has voiced superhero characters in Marvel Anime, Avengers Assemble, and Harley Quinn TV shows.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>WHO IS THE GOLDFISH ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’?
