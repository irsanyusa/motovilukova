One of the songs that's performed is "Death of a Bachelor," which was released as part of the 2016 album of the same name. During the shows, Urie walks through the crowd to greet fans, and it's known as the "death walk."</p><p>Some fans have been getting too close to the lead singer and Urie recently commented on the situation during a live stream on Twitch, which was shared by a fan on <a href=# id=189157fd-f0bb-324b-a365-baed50015d0d>Twitter</a> .</p><p>"I went in for a hug and a girl kissed my neck, my sweaty, gross neck," Urie recalled. "The neck kiss is so intimate, too It's like an extra 'F--- you!' to me. You know what I mean?"</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Urie added: "Please stop kissing me during the 'death walk.'"</p><p>This isn't the first time fans have been warned about how to behave at P!ATD concerts.</p><p>Zack Hall, the band's tour manager and security guard, recently <a href=# id=216783b4-ab9b-32f6-ac69-2d745fcf5d6c>said</a> that if he catches anyone trying to kiss Urie, they'll be "kicked out of the show right away."</p><p>Prior to that, Hall said that if the inappropriate actions continue, Panic! At the Disco might stop doing the "death walk."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"If people keep trying to lick, kiss or do weird creepy s--- during the 'death walk' we will for sure stop doing it," he <a href=# id=061ba602-0b0b-31ba-a511-7351dd49ab0b>tweeted</a> in late January. "It's a fun thing he [Urie] likes to do and enjoys being that close to you guys, but come on. Have some respect. (It's called that because he's walking while singing 'DOAB')."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8%2BapaKbXZbBbsDHnmSdoaOYvG6y0ailrWWdlrturtGepZ2nnmLCs7XEZpiso6Nis6K60marqGWgobKiv8Rmqq2noGK4qr%2FSoqWgZZ2aeqXB0aKloGeXnMS6vM9r</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
