And just when you think you learned everything there is&nbsp;to&nbsp;know, you come across bits of&nbsp;trivia that catch you by&nbsp;surprise. Knowing some of&nbsp;these fun facts probably won’t advance our everyday lives much, but they’ll surely make any conversation a&nbsp;lot more interesting. And yes, knowing them can actually make you (feel) smarter.</p><p>Prepare to&nbsp;be&nbsp;amazed by&nbsp;these 20&nbsp;curious facts that we&nbsp;at<strong>&nbsp;Bright Side</strong> carefully selected for our list.</p><p><h2>1. In&nbsp;Japan, husbands receive a&nbsp;monthly allowance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b4/9b8/42bd4150cbb07521ac933f2f63.jpg><p>In&nbsp;many Japanese marriages, the wife is&nbsp;the one who controls the family budget and she gives a&nbsp;<strong>monthly allowance to&nbsp;her husband</strong> from his salary. The husband uses this money, known in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Japan data-link=tag>Japan</a> as ’’okozukai’’ to&nbsp;pay for his leisure activities, entertainment, and mobile phone bills. The value of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>okozukai</a> is&nbsp;usually around&nbsp;10% of&nbsp;the husband’s salary.</p><p><h2>2. 2%&nbsp;of&nbsp;people have the ’’anti-smell’’ gene.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d34/2fa/398651503c93f80e6571c46236.jpg><p>Most of&nbsp;us know how armpit smell can be&nbsp;embarrassing, but there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;small percentage of&nbsp;the world’s population that will never have to&nbsp;deal with this kind of&nbsp;annoyance. Scientists have discovered that&nbsp;2% of&nbsp;people have the ’’anti-smell’’ <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gene</a>, known as<strong>&nbsp;gene ABCC11. </strong>These lucky winners of&nbsp;the genetic lottery are <strong>not capable of&nbsp;producing odor under their armpits. </strong>But the rest of&nbsp;us can take some solace in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fact</a> that sweat itself doesn’t have a&nbsp;bad smell. The odor occurs when bacteria on&nbsp;your skin come into contact with the perspiration released by&nbsp;your sweat glands.</p><p><h2>3. Messy beds are actually healthier for&nbsp;us.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e1/5c1/9dddd554b897b63abaa9d2585e.jpg><p>Not making your bed straight away in&nbsp;the morning might look messy, but<strong> it’s actually healthier than throwing a&nbsp;comforter over&nbsp;it</strong>. A&nbsp;new <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> from Kingston University suggests that leaving the sheets untidily scattered across the mattress can kill around 1.5 million dust mites.</p><p><h2>4. Eggshells are being used to&nbsp;grow new human bones.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/75a/fd3/fd601d5efc8672dfe4e11db425.jpg><p>We&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;think about eggshells as&nbsp;a&nbsp;synonym for fragility, but in&nbsp;fact, they are much stronger than they seem. So&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that they can even be&nbsp;used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>material to&nbsp;make human bones</strong>. Scientists at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Massachusetts Lowell have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discovered</a> a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;help grow new bone by&nbsp;using crushed eggshell particles.</p><p><h2>5. Men have a&nbsp;longer tongue than women.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/99a/09c/d108815c2fab2bce3c7186c77d.jpg><p>The common<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> misconception</a> that women talk more than men cannot be&nbsp;scientifically confirmed. However, when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;tongue length, <strong>men are definitely in&nbsp;the lead</strong>. One <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> conducted at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Edinburgh confirmed that the average tongue length for adults is&nbsp;7.9&nbsp;cm for women and 8.5 centimeters for men. Does it&nbsp;have anything to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with who talks more, science has yet to&nbsp;determine.</p><p><h2>6. The Eiffel Tower can grow more than 6&nbsp;inches during the summer.</h2></p><p>One of&nbsp;the most famous <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>landmarks</a> in&nbsp;Europe changes height depending on&nbsp;the season. In&nbsp;the summer, when temperatures are over 40°C, <strong>the <a href=# title="Eiffel Tower" data-link=tag>Eiffel Tower</a> grows taller by&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;15&nbsp;cm</strong>. This is&nbsp;because the heat causes the metal material to&nbsp;expand, which results in&nbsp;an&nbsp;increase in&nbsp;the tower’s height. The heat can also cause the top of&nbsp;the tower to&nbsp;tilt by&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;17&nbsp;cm in&nbsp;summer.</p><p><h2>7. 4&nbsp;seconds is&nbsp;the perfect length of&nbsp;time to&nbsp;dunk your Oreos in&nbsp;milk.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/76f/3c4/548d9c5334b967fd65e2aaa636.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you have been trying to&nbsp;figure out for how long should you soak your Oreo in&nbsp;<a href=# title=milk data-link=tag>milk</a> without it&nbsp;becoming too soggy, you’ll appreciate the results of&nbsp;Utah State University <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>research</a>. After 2&nbsp;weeks of&nbsp;experimenting, scientists found that<strong> 4&nbsp;seconds is&nbsp;the ideal amount of&nbsp;soaking time</strong>. It&nbsp;allows Oreos to&nbsp;reach maximum absorption without falling apart or&nbsp;becoming too moist.<br><u>Bonus tip:</u> To&nbsp;avoid sticky fingers, use a&nbsp;fork for dipping.<br></p><p><h2>8. It’s impossible to&nbsp;tickle yourself.</h2></p><p>The human brain is&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;fascinating things&nbsp;— including predicting the future. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Studies</a> conducted at&nbsp;University College London showed that a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;our brain called<strong> </strong>the cerebellum can predict the tickling sensation but only when you try to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;by&nbsp;yourself. That’s why it <strong>’’turns off’’ the response and you don’t feel anything. </strong>When others do&nbsp;it, of&nbsp;course, our brain is&nbsp;caught by&nbsp;surprise, and we&nbsp;get a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;giggles. Go&nbsp;ahead, try and see for yourself.<br></p><p><h2>9. Jellyfish can be&nbsp;as&nbsp;big as&nbsp;humans.</h2></p><p>Barrel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>jellyfish</a>, or&nbsp;<strong>Rhizostoma Pulmo</strong>, can grow to&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;an&nbsp;average human, and even beyond. Weighting nearly 36&nbsp;kilograms, with a&nbsp;belly of&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;3&nbsp;feet wide, it&nbsp;surely is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fascinating but rare sight&nbsp;— one that you’d probably want to&nbsp;avoid on&nbsp;your snorkeling excursion.</p><p><h2>10. YouTube was founded on&nbsp;Valentine’s Day and started as&nbsp;a&nbsp;dating app.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f0/126/060ef45031b9b679a1d6a5e029.jpg><p><a href=# title=YouTube data-link=tag>YouTube</a>, everyone’s go-to platform for all kinds of&nbsp;entertaining videos and video tutorials, was originally intended for a&nbsp;different purpose. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>According</a> to&nbsp;founder, Steve Chen, when YouTube was launched on<strong>&nbsp;Valentine’s Day</strong> back in&nbsp;2005, the initial idea was to&nbsp;allow people to&nbsp;upload videos of&nbsp;themselves where they would talk about their <strong>romantic preferences</strong> and what kind of&nbsp;partner they were looking for.</p><p><h2>11. Men who have daughters live longer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c8b/a18/3a61bf50d391c290703db33715.jpg><p>We&nbsp;can’t say for sure if&nbsp;dads who have daughters are overall happier than those who have sons, but having girls can improve fathers’ longevity, according to&nbsp;one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a>. A&nbsp;group of&nbsp;scientists found that the number of&nbsp;daughters positively affected their fathers’ life span. On&nbsp;average, their<strong> longevity increased by&nbsp;74&nbsp;weeks per daughter born. On&nbsp;the other hand,</strong> the number of&nbsp;male offspring did not have any noticeable impact on&nbsp;their longevity.</p><p><h2>12. Victoria’s Secret perfume deters insects better than other commercial insect repellents.</h2></p><p>Mosquitos are those miniature, pesky creatures that can turn our outdoor adventure into a&nbsp;nightmare. But don’t fret, it&nbsp;seems that all you need is&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;perfume drops to&nbsp;successfully repel them. In&nbsp;one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a>, a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;scientists tested <strong>Avon’s Skin So&nbsp;Soft bath oil and Victoria’s Secret Bombshell</strong> perfume against well-known mosquito repellents. Surprisingly, both products performed remarkably well compared to&nbsp;other products intended for this purpose. They effectively deterred mosquitoes 120 minutes post application.</p><p><h2>13. The Mayan and Aztec People used cocoa beans as&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;currency.</h2></p><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;imagine that a&nbsp;product that is&nbsp;so&nbsp;widespread and accessible today was used as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>currency</a> at&nbsp;one point in&nbsp;history. For Mesoamericans, <strong>cocoa beans were as&nbsp;precious as&nbsp;our golden Mastercard today</strong>. The Aztecs and Mayans used it&nbsp;to&nbsp;pay for anything from taxes to&nbsp;food and clothing.</p><p><h2>14. The furry tufts of&nbsp;hair inside a&nbsp;cat’s ear are called ear furnishings.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/898/39a/52ee9a55439c04bfd88a837c2f.jpg><p>No&nbsp;matter how much we&nbsp;study them, it&nbsp;seems that we&nbsp;can never learn everything about these mysterious (and hilarious!) <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>animals</a>. For example, you probably didn’t know that the fur on&nbsp;the inner part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat’s ear is&nbsp;called <strong>furnishings</strong>. Even avid cat lovers often confuse them with <strong>tufts</strong>, which is&nbsp;the fur that covers the outer part of&nbsp;your fluffy pet’s ears. Adorable, isn’t it?</p><p><h2>15. Bats give birth upside down.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b98/b3b/e1f15b5995815693db190fdc14.jpg><p>We&nbsp;often admire bats for their unique ability to&nbsp;do&nbsp;almost everything while hanging upside down. They sleep and hibernate and even continue <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hanging</a> after they die. What’s more, female bats even give birth while in&nbsp;this<strong> gravity-defying position</strong>. When the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>baby</a> bat is&nbsp;born, the mother quickly catches it&nbsp;and holds it&nbsp;with her wings.<br></p><p><h2>16. Homework was once considered harmful for a&nbsp;child’s health.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d71/43d/aecc28582c8478335eba9ae1e6.jpg><p>Even though it’s been ages since after-school assignments were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>banned</a>, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>debate</a> on&nbsp;this topic seems to&nbsp;still be&nbsp;ongoing. The homework ban that was introduced in&nbsp;1901 in&nbsp;California affected <strong>all students younger than 15</strong>. Some doctors and teachers argued that it&nbsp;had a&nbsp;negative effect on&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s health as&nbsp;it&nbsp;caused them too much stress. However, the carefreeness of&nbsp;schoolkids was relatively short-lived, only a&nbsp;little more than a&nbsp;decade passed before homework was re-introduced in&nbsp;1917.</p><p><h2>17. Lobsters used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;prison food.</h2></p><p>Before restaurants put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>menu</a> in&nbsp;the 1880s, lobster was so&nbsp;abundant and affordable that it&nbsp;was labeled: “poor man’s protein.” Before it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;pricey delicacy, <strong>lobster was often given to&nbsp;prisoners </strong>as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;low-grade food.</p><p><h2>18. In&nbsp;the 15th century pregnancy was very trendy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f53/ce1/66ef8f59eb9e5e01023c7bcf30.jpg><p>Much like today, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pregnancy</a> was very fashionable in&nbsp;the 15th <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>century</a>, so&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that even women who were not pregnant sometimes <strong>wore stuffed pads under their clothes</strong> to&nbsp;imitate a&nbsp;baby bump. And this was way before maternity clothes were even invented.</p><p><h2>19. Our brain cannot create new faces in&nbsp;our dreams.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a4/284/e5e1ea576691b88004c67dac57.jpg><p>Our brain is&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;many incredible things, but ’’inventing’’ entirely new faces in&nbsp;our dreams is&nbsp;not one of&nbsp;them. Neuroscientists <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believe</a> that every person you dream of&nbsp;has been someone you have seen before in&nbsp;some way&nbsp;— either <strong>an&nbsp;acquaintance, a&nbsp;friend, or&nbsp;just a&nbsp;stranger </strong>you passed by&nbsp;on&nbsp;the street for a&nbsp;second.</p><p><h2>20. Erasers were invented 200 years after pencils.</h2></p><p>Although pencils have been with&nbsp;us for about 400&nbsp;years, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>erasers</a> came along long after that&nbsp;— some 200 years to&nbsp;be&nbsp;precise. Until the 18th century, when rubber became the primary material for erasers, people relied on&nbsp;<strong>sponges or&nbsp;even pieces of&nbsp;bread</strong> to&nbsp;cover up&nbsp;pencil marks or&nbsp;remove mistakes.<br></p><p>What’s the strangest fun fact about the world around&nbsp;us that you had to&nbsp;check to&nbsp;make sure is&nbsp;true?
