And <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Henry Cavill</a>, who has been portraying <i>Superman</i> on&nbsp;the big screen for almost a&nbsp;decade, was replaced in&nbsp;this iconic role. Even though this decision came as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise to&nbsp;the actor himself, his reaction was admirable, and it&nbsp;made&nbsp;us appreciate him all the more.</p><p><h2>Cavill made a&nbsp;sad announcement.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1bc/8d6/be8e1850c6a6b03280dabf224c.jpg><p>The actor, who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first</a> took the role of&nbsp;<i>Superman</i> in&nbsp;2013, announced that he&nbsp;will no&nbsp;longer be&nbsp;portraying the beloved superhero on&nbsp;the big screen. Cavill <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> on&nbsp;his <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>, “It’s sad news, everyone. I&nbsp;will, after all, not be&nbsp;returning as&nbsp;Superman.” He&nbsp;added, “this news isn’t the easiest, but that’s life.”</p><p><h2>The news came as&nbsp;a&nbsp;shock.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/975/a3c/e676f757ca8adac73006ad4000.jpg><p>This announcement was even more devastating to&nbsp;the star’s fans, given that he&nbsp;had previously shared an&nbsp;Instagram video revealing that he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;back in&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;<i>Superman</i> in&nbsp;the next movie.</p><p>In&nbsp;that video, Cavill had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a>, “I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;official that I&nbsp;am back as&nbsp;Superman.” He&nbsp;also thanked his fans for always being there for him, saying, “Thank you for your support, and thank you for your patience. I&nbsp;promise it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;rewarded.”</p><p><h2>The reason behind the decision</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/599/9be/b1b1b456798a5dd2e27958eedf.jpg><p>The decision to&nbsp;replace Cavill was, in&nbsp;fact, made by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>James Gunn</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Peter Safran</a>, the<strong> </strong>2&nbsp;heads of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>DC&nbsp;Films</a>, the company that is&nbsp;responsible for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Superman</i></a> franchise.</p><p>Gunn <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> his decision about not casting Cavill again, by&nbsp;noting, “Our story will be&nbsp;focusing on&nbsp;an&nbsp;earlier part of&nbsp;Superman’s life, so&nbsp;the character will not be&nbsp;played by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Henry Cavill" data-link=tag>Henry Cavill</a>.” He&nbsp;also insisted that their relationship with the actor isn’t compromised and that they are open to&nbsp;collaborating with him again on&nbsp;other projects. The new chief of&nbsp;DC&nbsp;Films noted, “We’re big fans, and we&nbsp;talked about a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;exciting possibilities to&nbsp;work together in&nbsp;the future.”</p><p><h2>Superman will forever stay...</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/578/08e/3c31135f6e92755d4289b430c7.jpg><p>Having played the superhero for almost a&nbsp;decade, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;safe to&nbsp;say that Henry feels attached to&nbsp;the iconic character and feels sad to&nbsp;be&nbsp;leaving him behind. However, the actor proved that he&nbsp;doesn’t hold any hard feelings about this sudden change of&nbsp;direction and that he&nbsp;will always have the superhero’s best interests at&nbsp;heart.</p><p>Cavill <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, “Superman is&nbsp;still around. Everything he&nbsp;stands for still exists, and the examples he&nbsp;sets for&nbsp;us are still there!” He&nbsp;then added, “My&nbsp;turn to&nbsp;wear the cape has passed, but what Superman stands for never will. It’s been a&nbsp;fun ride with you all, onwards and upwards!”</p><p>Among the numerous actors who have portrayed Superman, Henry Cavill stands out as&nbsp;a&nbsp;favorite. Yet, amidst his celebrity status, he&nbsp;wholeheartedly devotes himself to&nbsp;<a href=#>one woman</a> who not only shares his professional ventures but also his personal life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWmutGyZJyZpp65rXnRnq2emZyoeqmx0maZnp2eYrOqvsSdZJ%2Bqn6J6tMHPnqmmmZ5it7a%2F02aunp2bqHqistOeqWaZnqO8trrCoqWgZZiewG6uyKBkq52kqr%2BvedOoZK2glWK%2FsLjEZm9qaGRpgHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
