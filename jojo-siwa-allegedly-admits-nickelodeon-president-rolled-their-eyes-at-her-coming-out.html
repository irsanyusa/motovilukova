The popular dancer recently dropped a bomb on TikTok, exposing the treatment she endured after she came out in January 2021. Although Siwa did not name drop, many assume that the 19 year-old is referencing her time at Nickelodeon.</strong></p><p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: Since this article has been published, Nickelodeon has responded to our request for a comment. On March 23, a Nickelodeon spokesperson shared:</p><p>“We are unaware of what incident or meeting JoJo is referencing, but it certainly did not happen at Nickelodeon. We have valued and supported JoJo since day one of our relationship together and we still do today.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-siwa-was-allegedly-pulled-into-a-meeting-questioned-by-previous-employer-after-coming-out>JoJo Siwa Was Allegedly Pulled into a Meeting, Questioned By Previous Employer After Coming Out</h2><p>Almost every fan of Siwa remembers when she was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">snubbed by the TV network</a> when she wasn’t invited to the annual Kids’ Choice Awards a year after her coming out. Even though Siwa was nominated for an award, she admitted that the network’s invitation to the event never made it to her inbox (..or mailbox, if Nickelodeon uses snail mail).</p><p>Now, on March 23, Siwa has seemingly exposed exactly what happened when she came out. While lip syncing to Meghan Trainor’s “Mother,” Siwa told the behind-the-scenes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">January 2021</a>. The beginning of the video is titled: “STORY TIME: January 2021 I come out to the world The company I work for told me they needed to have a meeting w/ me ASAP.”</p><p>She went on to explain that once in a meeting with her work’s president, they asked her what she would tell her “young demographic.” Siwa shared that she took a moment, then replied with “THE TRUTH.”</p><p>“I’ve never seen a man roll his eyes so far in the back of his head….” JoJo added. “It was silent so I started talking again… I said… ‘I’m not gonna hide who I am and who I love to anyone, ESPECIALLY to the next generation.'”</p><p>She then went on to admit the president didn’t like that answer. In turn, Siwa admitted that many adults were envious of her coming out, saying ‘I wish I had someone like you when I was younger.'”</p><p>Siwa completed her video with a powerful statement about acceptance. “Which reminds me everytime that I did the right thing and to never let ANYONE change who you are,” she wrote.</p><a title=@itsjojosiwa href=# rel=noopener>@itsjojosiwa</a><p>Inspired by a true story.😨 (side note if that meeting was today I would literally just press play on this song….)</p><a title="♬ Mother - Meghan Trainor" href=# rel=noopener>♬ Mother – Meghan Trainor</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans Were Quick to Praise Her</h2><p>Since this social media video has aired, fans have been quick to comment support to the dancer. It’s no secret that Siwa has tons of extremely dedicated fans from her time on TV. After rising to fame on Dance Moms and proceeding to become a huge name on Nickelodeon, it’s no surprise that this issue is making waves at the moment.</p><p>Siwa is not the first celebrity to come out, yet, most likely due to her age, the network clearly wasn’t okay with it. Now, after nearly two years, the dancer is spreading a positive message to her fans that stuck around.</p><p>“My daughter loves you, she’s 6, and I always use you as an example of loving whoever you want! I say ‘yep like Jojo Siwa’,” a fan commented on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a>.</p><p>Other fans were quick to say that Nickelodeon is in their “flop era.” In addition, many thanked Siwa for always staying true to herself, no matter the situation.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original_IdolJudges_SaraBeth-220x147.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Contestant Sara Beth Calls Katy Perry’s Comments ‘Hurtful’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaihqGWjnsSiecClo56flZm5unnAnaSirKNiu6qvyp6jqJyVpLtuvNGeqqKclaPBbr7OpaOenF2ptaa10Wacsp2jYq61eceeqWabn6K2r7OMqKytZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
