She previously said she was “excited and terrified all at the same time” as she waited to give birth. The dancer made it clear that she was trying to avoid having a C-Section. “Carson was born three weeks early and at nine pounds, so he was a really big boy and I just don’t want the risk of having a C-section,” she said in an Instagram video.</p><p>Before the baby arrived, Witney kept her fans updated on her labor in her Instagram stories. She said that she got an epidural and was “feeling great.” She also shouted out her husband for being so supportive throughout the entire process.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CJl59_Zhxjw/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>PREGNANT ASHLEY TISDALE FLASHES BABY BUMP ON ‘THE MASKED DANCER’ — ALL ABOUT HER PREGNANCY</a></strong></p><p>Much to her dismay, Witney ultimately did end up having a C-Section which she revealed in an Instagram post. “After a really hard 24-hour labor, and an unexpected c-section… we are all healthy and well. We are so grateful & we’ve been soaking up every moment with our perfect angel boy. Thank you for all the prayers!” she wrote.

The post received a lot of love in the comments section with tons of fans and friends wishing the couple a big congratulations. The couple first met when they were children and always had a deep connection.
