However, to know if someone has unfriended you, there are various ways to follow. Below is a <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/guides/1100111-how-share-data-airtel/ href=#>simple guide</a> to see if you have been unfriended on the app.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7fbfcde6df4d0427.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33 fun games to play with your girlfriend on WhatsApp</span></p></a><h3 id=1575797-1-you-cannot-view-their-snapcode class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>1. You cannot view their Snapcode</h3><p class=align-left>When you have been unfriended on the app, you cannot see their Snap<a href=#>code</a>. A Snapcode is a unique image that looks like a QR code used for different things on the platform. Snapcodes can be used to add new friends, link to websites, and connect to exclusive content. If you cannot view the code, the user has unadded you.</p><h3 id=1575797-2-you-cannot-view-their-snapscore class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. You cannot view their Snapscore</h3><p class=align-left>Snapscore is a number that indicates how active you are on the platform. This score is based on how many Snaps and messages you send and receive. You should be able to see your friend's score if you both follow each other.</p><h3 id=1575797-3-you-are-unable-to-find-their-username-or-full-name-on-snapchat class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>3. You are unable to find their username or full name on Snapchat</h3><p class=align-left>There are different ways to find a user on the app. You <a href=#>can</a> search for their username directly or sync your phone's contacts. To know someone has unadded you, type the person's username in the search bar. If the person's name does not appear, they have unadded or blocked you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/11760bfb298ed4ec.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ good Discord bio ideas to put in the ‘about me’ section</span></p></a><h3 id=1575797-4-your-shared-snaps-or-messages-are-pending class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4.

You are no longer friends if you recently sent snaps and they are still pending. You can <a href=#>send a message</a> to confirm the status, and if it shows pending, you have been unfriended.</p><h3 id=1575797-5-they-are-active-when-you-use-a-different-account class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. They are active when you use a different account</h3><p class=align-left>Another way to determine whether someone has unadded you is to use another Snapchat account.

If your friend has unadded you, they cannot view your stories. Although this is not always the case, it could give you an idea of who is still on your friend list.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/496d8a4ed7fa20d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What does WYLL mean on Snapchat or text and how to respond</span></p></a><h3 id=1575797-7-checking-your-chat-history-and-contact-list class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>7.
