She was known for her alleged promiscuity and political influence during her time as empress.</p><p>Messalina came from a noble family with close ties to the imperial line. She was a paternal cousin of Nero, second cousin of <a href=#>Caligula</a>, and great-grandniece of <a href=#>Augustus</a>. Messalina married Claudius in 38 AD when she was a teenager and he was in his late forties. The couple had two children together, Claudia Octavia and Britannicus.</p><p>In 41 AD, Messalina became empress when Claudius was named emperor after the assassination of Caligula. During her time as empress, she gained a reputation for using her position to eliminate rivals and increase her wealth. Stories of her alleged sexual exploits spread throughout Rome, though some believe this to have been propaganda.</p><p>Messalina's downfall came in 48 AD when she reportedly married her lover, Gaius Silius, in a public ceremony while Claudius was away. Upon learning of this, Claudius ordered her execution. According to historical accounts, Messalina was given the option to take her own life but was ultimately killed by a guard.</p><p>After her death, the Roman Senate attempted to erase Messalina from public memory by removing her name and images from public spaces. This practice was called damnatio memoriae, which means "condemnation of memory" in Latin.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>January 25</a>, <a href=#>17</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Rome, Italy<br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Aquarius</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>48 AD</a><br></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Emperors</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwucSsqpqkmaOu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
