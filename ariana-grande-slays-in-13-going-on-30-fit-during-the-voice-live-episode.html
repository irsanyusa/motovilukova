The pop star showed off her movie-loving side by dressing as Jenna Rink from</strong><a href=#><strong> </strong><strong>13 Going on 30</strong></a><strong>. Fans of the iconic film caught on to the fact that Grande was dressed as the character, but missed a key detail.</strong></p><p>Grande was seen wearing a 2000‚Äôs styled dress that was almost identical to the dress from the 2004 movie. The pop singer thanked Versace for the dress on her Instagram story before the<a href=#> The Voice began</a>. Although this dress is extremely similar, the stripes are a little different. Grande‚Äôs dress had bigger stripes that featured less colors than the actress in the film.</p><p>Fans of The Voice were happy to see Grande in this iconic film look, but noticed a key detail missing. Grande wasn‚Äôt wearing a necklace with the dress! In 13 Going on 30, the main character is wearing a big butterfly necklace with this dress. Some might think this detail is minor, but lovers of the film know that it is a big part of the plot. I think we can overlook this mishap though. This pop singer has<a href=#> nailed looks from this film</a> before in one of her music videos. Instead of being upset that she forgot the necklace, let‚Äôs just admit that she nailed this look once again.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>But where‚Äôs the butterfly ü¶ã necklace that goes with it??</p>‚Äî Kyle G.

Up to this point, we‚Äôve seen the coach in multiple<a href=#> other stylish outfits</a>, so I definitely didn‚Äôt expect a film-based look. This dress has recently become a huge fashion statement since it is now being sold on Amazon.</p><p>Over the summer TikTok users freaked out over the fact that the dress from 13 Going on 30 had a perfect replica for<a href=#> only $13</a>. This news was originally shared by<a href=#> Christa Allen</a>, the actress who played the younger version of Jennifer Garner in the movie.</p><p>Since this dress is now so available (in versions not made by Versace), there were tons of people who dressed up as Jenna Rink for halloween. Maybe Grande was showing off her abilities to follow a trend, or maybe she was trying to remind us of her iconic ‚ÄúThank U Next‚Äù music video. This video practically broke the internet on its release date from all of the film references.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AlterEgo_JudgeAvatars_GROUP_Rd2_02_V3.jpg alt="‚ÄòAlter Ego‚Äô Judges Get Avatars of Their Own in Upcoming Episodes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ariana grande</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKugmqaRYrSzrc2dnGarnJbGtHnIp2Rqa12cvKq6xmamp2VjZXqntdNmm66qmaO0bsDHnmSvp5mYsm64yK%2BcZp2gnsCwsMRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
