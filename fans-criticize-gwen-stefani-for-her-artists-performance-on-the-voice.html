That artist is BIAS, who took the stage during Monday’s Semifinals to perform “Bless the Broken Road” by Rascal Flatts. Some fans have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">criticized Stefani</a> for not properly coaching BIAS ahead of the performance.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-criticize-gwen-stefani-for-the-voice-artist-bias>Fans Criticize Gwen Stefani for The Voice Artist BIAS</h2><p>This week’s show featured songs chosen by fans for the artists to sing. BIAS ended up singing “Bless the Broken Road,” and he dedicated the performance to his wife. He said she was “the whole reason I auditioned for the show.”</p><p>The performance wasn’t exactly a hit with everyone online. One viewer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> on X (formerly Twitter) that the singer was “off pitch quite often in that performance,” adding that “pitch problems are almost the norm with Gwen’s contestants.”</p><p>“So how many more country classic songs is he going to destroy with her coaching before he is voted off?” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> another viewer in response to Stefani’s tweet hyping BIAS up. “Another POP star in country in the making.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GWEN STEFANI TEASES NEW MUSIC IN SPOTIFY WRAPPED 2023 MESSAGE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-some-fans-wonder-how-bias-made-it-this-far>Some Fans Wonder How BIAS Made It This Far</h2><p>For his Blind Audition, BIAS performed “God’s Country” by former The Voice coach (and Stefani’s husband) Blake Shelton. Both Stefani and Reba McEntire turned their chairs, and BIAS chose to join Team Gwen.</p><p>BIAS went on to win his Battle and Knockout on Team Gwen. He was one of three artists on Stefani’s team in the Top 12 during last week’s Quarterfinals. Two of those artists — Tanner Massey and Kara Tenae — were eliminated.</p><p>That made BIAS the only singer left on Stefani’s team going into the Top 9 this week. Some fans don’t think the singer should have made it that far. One user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> that BIAS is “dive bar level,” adding, “I’m honestly mad about the talent that’s gone home before him.”</p><p>What do you think? Does BIAS deserve to still be in the competition? Will he make it through Tuesday’s results show?
