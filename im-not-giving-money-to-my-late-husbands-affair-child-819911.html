This is&nbsp;the case for a&nbsp;woman who, after the loss of&nbsp;her husband, finds herself confronting a&nbsp;painful and unexpected dilemma.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband passed away nearly three years ago, leaving me&nbsp;to&nbsp;raise our 8-year-old child on&nbsp;my&nbsp;own. Since his death, I’ve uncovered truths about him that would have ended our marriage had he&nbsp;been alive.</p><p>About six weeks ago, a&nbsp;process server came looking for him with a&nbsp;court order to&nbsp;submit DNA for a&nbsp;paternity test. I&nbsp;handed him a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;the death certificate and sent him on&nbsp;his way.</p><p>Not long after, a&nbsp;woman appeared at&nbsp;my&nbsp;door with a&nbsp;child, claiming this was my&nbsp;late husband’s son. Is&nbsp;it? I&nbsp;don’t know, and honestly, I&nbsp;don’t care. The child resembles him, but he’s young enough that he&nbsp;must have been conceived just before my&nbsp;husband’s death.</p><p>I&nbsp;informed her that he&nbsp;had passed away and directed her to&nbsp;his grave. Almost immediately, she began demanding ’her half’ of&nbsp;his estate. I&nbsp;couldn’t help but laugh and tell her that half of&nbsp;nothing was nothing, and she was welcome to&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/132/6dd/ea82275d66b61606bdf327f685.jpg><p>I would have then asked for her half due for the funeral and medical costs etc. he paid rent and did not have a estate. but she is welcome to pay half of his bills.</p><p>Where I&nbsp;might be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;the bad guy is&nbsp;that, while there was no&nbsp;estate, there were assets that bypassed probate. One of&nbsp;those was a&nbsp;rental property given to&nbsp;us by&nbsp;his parents, deeded to&nbsp;us as&nbsp;joint tenants with rights of&nbsp;survivorship. When he&nbsp;died, it&nbsp;became mine.</p><p>I’ve since sold the property, and that money will go&nbsp;toward our child’s college education. Legally, I’m covered—I’ve already consulted my&nbsp;attorney. While I&nbsp;do feel sympathy for this child, my&nbsp;priority is&nbsp;my&nbsp;own.</p><p><h2>People stood on&nbsp;her side.</h2></p><ul><li>“You were not a&nbsp;jerk. And for what it’s worth, that’s not a&nbsp;terribly uncommon scam for some reason. If&nbsp;you still have the papers, I’d look into if&nbsp;they were even legitimate.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>O***Vegetable&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“I&nbsp;would have said, ‘He&nbsp;died with a&nbsp;ton of&nbsp;debt. Let me&nbsp;get your info, so&nbsp;I can transfer half of&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;you.’ She would be&nbsp;out of&nbsp;there so&nbsp;fast!” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>New_Standard_8609&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“You need to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;your child and your finances. The property legally belongs to&nbsp;you, and there’s no&nbsp;proof your late husband was the father of&nbsp;the other child. Your priority is&nbsp;your own child’s future.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Trick-Measurement-20&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c1/d42/fbdd335cca96dad2de96615ac9.jpg><ul><li>“Unless she has a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;prove paternity, you have ZERO obligations to&nbsp;her or&nbsp;her affair baby. Even if&nbsp;he&nbsp;is, the rental property was in&nbsp;your name, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was not your husband’s to&nbsp;give away. Remember, she chose to&nbsp;wreck your house. I&nbsp;would not open the door for her.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mi_nombre_es_ricardo&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“Don’t even give a&nbsp;second of&nbsp;thought about this again. Just tell yourself, ‘It&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;scam.’ And never talk to&nbsp;that person again, get a&nbsp;restraining order if&nbsp;it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;it. Having said that, if&nbsp;you ever are served with papers (i.e.&nbsp;an&nbsp;actual lawsuit has been filed) then lawyer up&nbsp;immediately and vigorously defend yourself.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Apprehensive-Care20z&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“It’s between your late hubby and his baby momma. You received sole possession of&nbsp;all assets upon his death, and you owe nothing to&nbsp;the baby momma. She should have informed him she was pregnant with his child while he&nbsp;was alive if&nbsp;she knew. Why did she wait 3&nbsp;years to&nbsp;come forward?” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Funny247365&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLauec2oq2afmau2r7OMpqannaliwbB5zLJkpZmkmnqpwdKbmKeco2Kup7LAoqlmm5ieuaV5l2pwcmlhZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
