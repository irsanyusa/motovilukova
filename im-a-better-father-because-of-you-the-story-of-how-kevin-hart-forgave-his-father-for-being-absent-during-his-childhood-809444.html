But he&nbsp;didn’t always have it&nbsp;easy. He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;troubled <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a> due to&nbsp;his absent father. Sadly, his dad passed away recently, and Hart honored his memory with a&nbsp;touching post that shows just how much love he&nbsp;had for his father despite his shortcomings.</p><p><h2>Hart used his painful childhood memories as&nbsp;punch lines for his stand-up comedy acts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a39/a5d/0118a6543b9aa91ca8e237f5d8.jpg><p>The comedian’s father, Henry Witherspoon, suffered from personal struggles and anger issues when Hart was younger. He&nbsp;was not very present in&nbsp;his children’s lives, and eventually, his mother decided to&nbsp;raise their 2&nbsp;kids by&nbsp;herself.</p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recap</a> of&nbsp;Hart’s biographical documentary on&nbsp;Netflix shows&nbsp;us how Hart used his childhood memories for his funny bits. He&nbsp;talked about his dad throwing him in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pool when he&nbsp;didn’t know how to&nbsp;swim. Hart also said that one time, his father stole the $20&nbsp;he received as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift, and even stole the neighbor’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dog</a>.</p><p>“The reason I&nbsp;am the way I&nbsp;am is&nbsp;because my&nbsp;mom was strong,” Hart explained in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>article</a>. “She said, ’Look, regardless of&nbsp;whatever your father’s doing and where he&nbsp;is, I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;job to&nbsp;do&nbsp;raising you...and you’re going to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;2&nbsp;intelligent men,’ me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;brother.”</p><p><h2>His father’s behavior greatly influenced the kind of&nbsp;dad that Hart wanted to&nbsp;be.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/661/8d9/f6d8355b88b01daf9234fbc553.jpg><p>The actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that his kids think he’s the “coolest dad on&nbsp;the planet.” He&nbsp;believes that witnessing firsthand what kind of&nbsp;impact an&nbsp;absent father leaves on&nbsp;his children made him want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;better.</p><p>“The way&nbsp;I look at&nbsp;it&nbsp;now, I’m such a&nbsp;great father because&nbsp;I don’t want to&nbsp;make the mistakes that my&nbsp;dad made,” said Hart. In&nbsp;one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, he&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;the grown man that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;today because of&nbsp;all the trials and tribulations that he&nbsp;experienced to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;where he&nbsp;is&nbsp;now.</p><p><h2>Hart and his brother took it&nbsp;upon themselves to&nbsp;help their dad become a&nbsp;better person.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/858/e3a/80b7c85e24af6520eae0eee015.jpg><p>At&nbsp;their father’s lowest point, they took him back in&nbsp;and gave him the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>help</a> he&nbsp;needed. They placed him in&nbsp;an&nbsp;institution where he&nbsp;learned to&nbsp;turn his life around. Luckily, Hart was doing well in&nbsp;his career, and he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;position to&nbsp;provide for his father.</p><p>“Here’s a&nbsp;home, here’s a&nbsp;car. Here’s some money. Go&nbsp;spend time with your grandkids. Be&nbsp;the best grandpop. The days that you missed with me&nbsp;were the days that you missed, that’s fine. I’m okay with that,” he&nbsp;explained in&nbsp;one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a>. But he&nbsp;also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clarified</a>, “You can’t fake a&nbsp;bond that’s not a&nbsp;bond.” While there was father-and-son love between them, the special bond still needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;earned.</p><p><h2>Hart credits his positive outlook as&nbsp;the reason why he&nbsp;is&nbsp;able to&nbsp;look past his father’s mistakes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec5/8b3/f6621c5e05a2e4af83d4704382.jpg><p>When he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;guest on&nbsp;<i>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</i>, Hart <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;was strong enough to&nbsp;deal with it&nbsp;because&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;different attitude. I’m a&nbsp;positive guy. I&nbsp;choose to&nbsp;go&nbsp;positive instead of&nbsp;negative. And because of&nbsp;that, my&nbsp;relationship with my&nbsp;dad is&nbsp;amazing now, and my&nbsp;dad understands how&nbsp;I feel and how&nbsp;I look at&nbsp;things. And my&nbsp;dad is&nbsp;focusing on&nbsp;being the best grandparent.”</p><p>He&nbsp;continued, “You always have a&nbsp;choice to&nbsp;make. My&nbsp;thing&nbsp;is, I&nbsp;don’t have time to&nbsp;be&nbsp;angry. You know how much time it&nbsp;takes to&nbsp;hold an&nbsp;attitude and a&nbsp;grudge? That’s time and energy! I&nbsp;don’t have that time!”</p><p><h2>The actor expressed his love for his father when he&nbsp;paid tribute to&nbsp;him on&nbsp;social media.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc1/ab2/2c08e45aaea0da81f507553875.jpg><p>Their mended relationship allowed Hart and his father to&nbsp;spend some time together as&nbsp;a&nbsp;complete, happy family. Sadly, Witherspoon recently passed away at&nbsp;age&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>73</a>, and Hart took to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> to&nbsp;honor his dad. He&nbsp;posted photos of&nbsp;their fun times together, and he&nbsp;thanked his father for everything. Hart lovingly ended the caption by&nbsp;saying, “I’m a&nbsp;better father because of&nbsp;you. We&nbsp;will all make you proud.”</p><p>How about you, how would you describe your relationship with your parents?
