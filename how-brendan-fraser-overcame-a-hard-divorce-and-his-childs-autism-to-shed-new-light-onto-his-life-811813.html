No&nbsp;matter how much time has gone by&nbsp;since his first public appearance, Fraser is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;our hearts. Aside from being a&nbsp;fantastic actor, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;loving father to&nbsp;his children.

By&nbsp;the time they were married in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1998</a>, Fraser had established himself as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>’s most bankable leading men. And Smith even had a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his <a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a>&nbsp;— which also happened to&nbsp;be&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>last one</a> for which she was given credit.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/688/64c/51fcb25711bb1ccf695e52f9f9.jpg><p>Fraser’s career suffered a&nbsp;snag just before his divorce from Smith in&nbsp;2007. Unfortunately, Fraser and Afton Smith’s love ended at&nbsp;that time when they revealed their divorce to&nbsp;the world. However, as&nbsp;they both <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>proclaimed</a>, they were committed to&nbsp;continuing a&nbsp;close, loving relationship.</p><p>Despite the numerous debates surrounding their divorce, they eventually reached an&nbsp;agreement, especially for the benefit of&nbsp;their 3&nbsp;children. Fraser, on&nbsp;the other hand, overcame challenges and a&nbsp;difficult split that nearly wrecked his bright career, but he’s now finally ready for his thrilling return to&nbsp;the big screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/428/d54/d6955f520aba7a6fe53de6cdf5.jpg><p>Evan Agostini/Invision/East News</p><p>Fraser and his wife had 3&nbsp;boys during their 9-year marriage, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;dedicated and caring parent to&nbsp;them. “Having kids makes your life better, plain and simple,” Fraser <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>declared</a>. Griffin Arthur Fraser arrived in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2002</a>, followed by&nbsp;Holden Fletcher Fraser in&nbsp;2004 and Leland Francis Fraser in&nbsp;2006.</p><p>With regard to&nbsp;his personal life, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;those of&nbsp;his children, Fraser is&nbsp;a&nbsp;private person. Holden and Leland, however, joined Fraser for the presentation of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Whale</i></a>, breaking with tradition and making a&nbsp;rare public appearance.</p><p>The actor expressed how deeply moved he&nbsp;was by&nbsp;the event and revealed that his kids had also surprised him after learning of&nbsp;his Best Actor Oscar nomination. Fraser <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>, “The feeling of&nbsp;sharing that moment with my&nbsp;loved ones is&nbsp;now a&nbsp;core memory of&nbsp;mine.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/061/4e7/0aa8e2570dbdefed479456b812.jpg><p>EVERETT COLLECTION/EAST NEWS</p><p>No&nbsp;matter how successful and well-known an&nbsp;actor he&nbsp;may&nbsp;be, Fraser will always prioritize his children, going to&nbsp;whatever lengths to&nbsp;ensure their happiness and well-being. Indeed, the star takes any opportunity to&nbsp;let them know how much he&nbsp;cares for them.</p><p>“I&nbsp;always hug and kiss them whether they like it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>. “<strong>I’d throw myself in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;train if&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;for their well-being</strong>. That doesn’t mean you can protect them from everything, but you have to&nbsp;try.”</p><h2>Coping with Griffin’s <a href=#>autism</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/832/4b8/4c9a66514499024acf67f302eb.jpg><p>Fraser’s life hasn’t been all sunshine and rainbows, especially after his first child was diagnosed with autism. The actor recently came out about his son’s condition, always choosing to&nbsp;keep him out of&nbsp;the public eye. During a&nbsp;recent interview, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>he&nbsp;confessed</a>, “My&nbsp;oldest son, Griffin, has special needs. <strong>He’s autistic</strong>.”</p><p>Despite the sensitive situation, Fraser has discovered the value of&nbsp;love and devotion in&nbsp;raising his child in&nbsp;the best manner possible. “He&nbsp;needs extra love in&nbsp;the world, and he&nbsp;gets&nbsp;it,” the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> of&nbsp;his son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4c/e4d/6220f15e118ea8bcec6fb18dbd.jpg><p>Chris Pizzello/Invision/East News</p><p><strong>“He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;curative </strong>on&nbsp;everyone who meets him,” Fraser said as&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> his first son, praising him for the great person he&nbsp;is. “He&nbsp;doesn’t know what cynicism&nbsp;is. You can’t insult him. He&nbsp;can’t insult you,” he&nbsp;further <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>. “<strong>He’s the happiest person</strong> and&nbsp;is, in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life and many others, also the manifestation of&nbsp;love.”</p><p>Fraser also understands the importance of&nbsp;the assistance Griffin had from his younger brothers, who never missed an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;show their respect for him in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;give him a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;strength and value. Thus, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “Ever since they were small, one was always the spokesperson and the other was the enforcer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3bc/f20/bfc7da584fa176cefa7ea89749.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7bc/3b4/7a14fb5d7a9c885c967cb323a5.jpg><p>Associated Press/East News</p><p>Fraser’s experience with Griffin allowed him to&nbsp;go&nbsp;deeper into the part of&nbsp;an&nbsp;overweight parent in&nbsp;his recent film. Indeed, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;acknowledges that his son influenced him in&nbsp;identifying what would be&nbsp;valuable and vital to&nbsp;“shape” his character.</p><p>Talking about his son, the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “He&nbsp;just turned 20. He’s a&nbsp;big kid. He’s 6’5”.
