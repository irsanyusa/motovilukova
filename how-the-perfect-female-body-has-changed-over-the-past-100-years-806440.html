Over the last 100&nbsp;years, it&nbsp;has changed so&nbsp;many times, mostly due to&nbsp;new celebrities and styles that came into <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a>. So&nbsp;while we&nbsp;sometimes wish we&nbsp;looked like someone else, don’t forget that in&nbsp;the end, fashions always change and nothing is&nbsp;better than having confidence in&nbsp;your natural body.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> has collected a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;how the “perfect” body has changed over the years to&nbsp;show that all styles change and to&nbsp;encourage you to&nbsp;embrace your body as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is, whatever you look like.</p><p><h2>1910&nbsp;— The Gibson Girl</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/197/9c8/0ca2d65c8e978e19ee39a7c55c.jpg><p>This look was created by&nbsp;illustrator <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Charles Gibson</a>, and it&nbsp;was characterized by&nbsp;a&nbsp;long neck, sloping shoulders, big curly hair, and a&nbsp;tightly cinched corset. The feminine body looked like a&nbsp;figure 8&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;the tight corset. Linda M&nbsp;Scott wrote: “The Gibson Girl was not dainty...she was dark, regal in&nbsp;bearing, [and] quite tall.”</p><p><h2>1920&nbsp;— the flapper</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd6/1f2/d471bf5cf9aa94c68c795a5039.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 1920s, curves were gone, and people were in&nbsp;favor of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small busts and hips. This look is&nbsp;streamlined and petite, and the ideal woman was often much shorter than the tall 1910s look. The focus also moved to&nbsp;women’s legs, as&nbsp;shorter hemlines of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>flapper dresses</a> put them on&nbsp;display. Women also cut their long hair to&nbsp;shoulder-length as&nbsp;the bob became fashionable.</p><p><h2>1930&nbsp;— the soft siren</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c7b/f95/7627945c1789f1fbc3f30b6f61.jpg><p>This decade has longer hemlines but a&nbsp;more <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fitted silhouette</a> of&nbsp;clothing. The desire for a&nbsp;waist and a&nbsp;slightly more curvy figure returned. Now there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong waistline, and the return of&nbsp;a&nbsp;desire for stronger shoulders, busts, and hips. Women were supposed to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;more “feminine” shape, as&nbsp;fashion emphasized a&nbsp;more romantic look.</p><p><h2>1940&nbsp;— the star-spangled girl</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c7/7fd/899ca15a23b396cc2cef186e3b.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;the era of&nbsp;boxy, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>broad</a> shoulders. In&nbsp;this era, the aim was for a&nbsp;taller, more commanding look. This went with the angular fashion styles and aimed for a&nbsp;more long-limbed and squarer body shape. Fashion became more practical and less focused on&nbsp;glamour.</p><p><h2>1950&nbsp;— the hourglass</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/527/432/69b467576da1f9b263d19e12e1.jpg><p>The 1950s was a&nbsp;time that valued voluptuous, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hourglass</a> figures. The “perfect” body in&nbsp;this era was all curves&nbsp;— a&nbsp;small waist and a&nbsp;large bust and hips. There were even weight-gain supplements that women were advised to&nbsp;take to&nbsp;increase their curves!</p><p><h2>1960&nbsp;— the twig</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd7/f99/86b4865f3dbbbae176bfb71cdb.jpg><p>Suddenly in&nbsp;the 1960s, the curves of&nbsp;the 1950s were out. Now, we&nbsp;were back to&nbsp;a&nbsp;more <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>androgynous</a>, petite, slender look. The ideal was a&nbsp;fresh-faced, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>young</a>, girlish look. Narrow hips, a&nbsp;slim waist, and a&nbsp;petite bust were back in&nbsp;and were supported by&nbsp;the shrunken shift dresses that were fashionable at&nbsp;the time.</p><p><h2>1970&nbsp;— the disco diva</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4c5/27d/45f781587887ca1858309a2304.jpg><p>The party girl of&nbsp;the 1970s was pushed to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;slim-hipped, flat stomach body to&nbsp;rock the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disco fashions</a>of&nbsp;this era. The synthetic fabrics used in&nbsp;the 1970s clothing were also more revealing than in&nbsp;the past, so&nbsp;more of&nbsp;the figure could be&nbsp;seen. There was a&nbsp;slight move back to&nbsp;curves though, with a&nbsp;lean torso, but the return of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bigger bust was the ideal look. This was also when tanning became popular, and long, natural hair was in&nbsp;style.</p><p><h2>1980&nbsp;— the supermodel</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f9/ba4/146f99530ab1515a8288fe749c.jpg><p>The new feminine ideal of&nbsp;the 1980s was taken from the supermodels of&nbsp;the era. Tall, slim, and long legs became the “perfect” female body. This was also the beginning of&nbsp;fitness crazes, like jogging and aerobics, so&nbsp;for the first time, the body trend included women having muscles and being <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>strong</a>, fit, and toned.</p><p><h2>1990&nbsp;— the waif</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f17/bc6/d117bc5e1d953f911b5303c686.jpg><p>The 1990s are, again, a&nbsp;swinging opposite of&nbsp;the athletic supermodels of&nbsp;the1980s. This time, the gaunt, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>waif-like</a> look was&nbsp;in. This decade wanted women to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very thin, androgynous, and pale, inspired by&nbsp;the new era of&nbsp;smaller models and actresses.</p><p><h2>2000&nbsp;— the buff beauty</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b3/664/f8827458cfbf795feefe894657.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 2000s, the “perfect” body changed again. Now, the athletic look was back in&nbsp;with a&nbsp;desire for flat stomachs and “thigh gaps”&nbsp;— again, inspired by&nbsp;the models of&nbsp;the era. The female body in&nbsp;this era was all about appearing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>long</a> and lean.</p><p><h2>2010s&nbsp;— the booty</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/210/09a/3aedce5e8187c68a623f833f0e.jpg><p>The 2010s ushered in&nbsp;a&nbsp;new body ideal&nbsp;— the curvaceous body, especially with a&nbsp;more pronounced <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>posterior</a>. As&nbsp;diversity also became a&nbsp;focus and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>plus-size</a> models joined the mainstream, the focus was back on&nbsp;a&nbsp;more hourglass and curvy figure.</p><p><h2>The 2020s&nbsp;— the social media age</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab5/c2b/8984c25371a6707d6949333750.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surveys</a>, many people’s ideas of&nbsp;the “perfect” body for women are still slim and small. But this doesn’t correlate with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>average</a> size of&nbsp;women. Nowadays, with the rise of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Body Positivity</a> and Body Neutrality movements, we&nbsp;are beginning to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;move away from one single “perfect” body. More <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diverse bodies</a> are shown in&nbsp;the media and, due to&nbsp;social media, we&nbsp;are exposed to&nbsp;more “normal” women.</p><p>Finally, we&nbsp;are beginning to&nbsp;shed the idea that women have to&nbsp;look one particular way to&nbsp;be&nbsp;beautiful. Women are celebrating themselves as&nbsp;they are. This is&nbsp;beginning to&nbsp;send a&nbsp;better message that we&nbsp;shouldn’t aim to&nbsp;look like someone else.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you love about your body?
