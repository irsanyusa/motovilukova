The recent news of pop sensation Ariana Grande parting ways with her ex-husband, Dalton Gomez, has left fans in shock. While the split was confirmed earlier this week, sources close to the singer now reveal that she has moved on from the relationship.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sources-reveal-reasons-on-what-led-to-the-breakup>Sources Reveal Reasons On What Led To The Breakup</h2><p>Gomez, a luxury real estate agent, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grande</a>, the chart-topping performer, seemed like a picture-perfect couple on the surface. Yet, as insiders disclose, their separation stemmed from significant differences in their lifestyles and priorities.</p><p>One of the central factors in their breakup was Gomez’s strong religious beliefs, which he was deeply committed to. He was determined to make their marriage work, but it appeared that Grande had already emotionally moved on. Love is a complex journey, and when one partner is steadfast while the other has begun to wander, it often signals the beginning of the end.</p><p>After the news of their separation, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grande</a> was seen spending time with her Wicked costar, Ethan Slater. The two had developed a close bond while working together on the film adaptation of the beloved Broadway musical. Slater himself had recently separated from his wife, adding another layer of intrigue to the emerging romance.</p><p>Beyond the emotional dynamics, geographical distance played a significant role in the dissolution of Grande and Gomez’s marriage. Grande’s filming commitments in England for Wicked made it difficult for the couple to sustain a long-distance relationship. Gomez’s career as a real estate agent demanded his presence in Los Angeles, leaving little room for flexibility.</p><p>It has since been reported that Grande may have begun a fling with fellow Wicked costar, Ethan Slater. It was reported that the couple began seeing one another once they had broken off their respective marriages. Grande and Slater have yet to confirm the details of their romance at this time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dalton Gomez Is Reportedly “Devastated” by the Split, Hopes to “Win Her Back”</h2><p>The news of Grande’s split from Gomez has sent shockwaves through the entertainment world. However, it seems that the realtor is taking the separation particularly hard. Sources close to Gomez reveal that he is “devastated” by the breakup and had envisioned spending the rest of his life with Grande.</p><p>According to insiders, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">separation</a> was not what he wanted, and he is now hoping to “win her back.” Despite facing rocky patches in their relationship, Gomez is not ready to give up on their love story. He still holds hope for a fairy-tale ending and is willing to do whatever it takes to salvage their marriage.</p><p>Even though he has reportedly been casually dating to distract himself from the split, Gomez’s heart remains set on Grande, and he continues to believe that reconciliation is possible. As the public watches the unfolding of this emotional journey, it remains to be seen whether Grande and Gomez can find a way back to each other or if they will choose separate paths moving forward.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_KatandAlex_Jason-KempinGetty-Images-for-CMT-220x147.jpeg alt="‘American Idol’ Country Couple Kat and Alex Announce Split" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKugmqaRYrSzrc2dnGagkah6s7HPqKmtnZShxm65zq%2BcnWWfo3qnvs6mZKGdomKyuXnHrqqbmZ6ZeqWx0qmgrZ1dma6twM6nZKCnnZrHbsPAp6uippdiwbB5zJqinmWZqXq4u9GkZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
