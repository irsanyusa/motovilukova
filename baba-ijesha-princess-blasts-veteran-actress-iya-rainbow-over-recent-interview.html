You are not a good mother. I regret I ever respected you. I regret that I ever saw you as a mother and grandmother. You said you called for four days and that I did not answer you and that now they have released him," she said.</p><p>"For your information, you called me just once, telling me that I should go and release him. You were instructing me and I never disrespected you. I even took my time to explain to you. You told me that Baba Ijesha called you to help him beg me that he has offended me. I then asked you if he told you what he did and you said no he didn't."</p><p>For Princess, she is shocked that the one person she held in high esteem would make comments like that.</p><p>"You can just imagine. Mama Rainbow that I held in high esteem. If I was your child or the victim was your child, would you have done that? I did not expect this from you at all. You came and you were so insensitive to say you called me and were pleading for the case not to be escalated," she said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"How can you say such a thing. Don't ever! Anything that concerns me please just stay away from it because I used to respect you up until this evening. It is a shame."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-0c29fbd2-4d6d-4bf6-a595-defa4c5d93dc data-caption="Nollywood actor Baba Ijesha [NAN]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/vMvktkpTURBXy8wOWZhM2Q4ZGQwNmRiMzgzYTY2YjYzZmU0YTVmMGZlMS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNA9zCww></span><p>"If I was your child, would you come to me and say I should go and release somebody that is in police custody for a crime they are investigating? and then you go online to start saying I wanted to sneak out(of the court).

I am ashamed of you that you can come for me in that way at your age. Are you praying for this to happen to your children or your children's children?
