She was a prominent actress, aside from her influence as co-founder of Pickfordâ€“Fairbanks Studios, United Artists, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p><p>Pickford began her acting career as a child in Toronto, Canada. She later moved to the United States with her family and transitioned from stage to film. Pickford quickly became a popular actress, earning the nickname "The Biograph Girl" for her work with the Biograph Company.</p><p>In 1919, Pickford co-founded United Artists with <a href=#>Charlie Chaplin</a>, <a href=#>D. W. Griffith</a>, and <a href=#>Douglas Fairbanks</a>. This gave her more control over her career and the films she made. She starred in many successful silent films, including "Pollyanna" (1920) and "Little Lord Fauntleroy" (1921).</p><p>Pickford won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in "Coquette" (1929), her first talkie. Her career declined, however, with the rise of sound films. She retired from acting in 1933 but continued to produce films and work as a vice-president of United Artists.</p><p>Throughout her life, Pickford was involved in various business ventures and philanthropic efforts. She co-founded the Hollywood Studio Club and the Motion Picture Relief Fund to support those in the film industry. Pickford was married three times and adopted two children with her third husband, Charles "Buddy" Rogers.</p><p>Pickford's contributions were recognized with an Academy Honorary Award in 1976.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>April 8</a>, <a href=#>1892</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Toronto, Ontario, Canada</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Lost Generation</b></a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Aries</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>May 29</a>, <a href=#>1979</a> (aged 87)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Cerebral hemorrhage</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Acting Career</h2><h2>Personal Life</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1911-01-07</a> Actress Mary Pickford (19) weds actor Owen Moore (25)</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1920-03-02</a> Actress Mary Pickford (27) divorces actor Owen Moore (33) after 9 years of marriage</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1920-03-28</a> Actor <a href=#>Douglas Fairbanks</a> (36) marries actress Mary Pickford (28)</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1936-01-10</a> Actress Mary Pickford (44) divorces actor <a href=#>Douglas Fairbanks</a> (52) after 15 years of marriage</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1937-06-26</a> Canadian-American silent film actress Mary Pickford (45) weds her third and final husband American actor and bandleader Charles "Buddy" Rogers (32), until her death in 1979</li></ul><h2>References</h2><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Actresses</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwucCrsGaomZi4p7vRnQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
