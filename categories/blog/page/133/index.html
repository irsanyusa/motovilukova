But, as far back as the planning stages, Select Committee members indicated that they did have one historical analogy in mind: the 1973 Watergate hearings, which investigated President Richard Nixon’s role in the attempt to cover up a break-in at the office of the Democratic National Committee—and which led up toNixon’s Aug. <a href=../../../../watergate-january-6-hearings-trump-nixon.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../american-voices-camila-cabello.html>Camila Cabello on Fifth Harmony and Her Journey Going Solo</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
