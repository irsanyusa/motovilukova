Let’s take a look back at these unforgettable moments.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-cynthia-lee-fontaine-shoe-discontinuity>10. Cynthia Lee Fontaine, Shoe Discontinuity</h2><p>Amid a group performance, Cynthia Lee Fontaine kicked her shoe right off, but, luckily it was caught by Acid Betty. However, at the end of the number, Fontaine was wearing two shows, which caused fans to doubt the credibility of RuPaul’s Drag Race season eight.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Shannel, Medusa Headpiece</h2><p>Shannel later admitted that this is a calculated stunt, but RuPaul’s Drag Race season one would never be complete without her shocking wardrobe malfunction. Her Medusa-inspired runway look gained impressions when her headpiece suddenly fell off.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Vivacious, Stuck Zipper</h2><p>Vivacious was a contestant of RuPaul’s Drag Race season six. Apparently, she had a zipper struggle when she entered the Werk Room, having it stuck as she opens her costume for a face reveal. Fortunately, she quickly managed to redeem herself, birthing the iconic line, “Mother has arrived.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/CoFbdPdT-TA</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Chi Chi DeVayne, Breaking Beads</h2><p>There’s no denying that <a href=# class=broken_link>Chi Chi DeVayne’s</a> lip sync to “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” by Jennifer Holliday was one of the most iconic performances in season eight. Accidentally, her dress during performance has rained beads all over the stage. Despite so, DeVayne managed to incorporate this wardrobe malfunction in her performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Aubrey Haive, Insect Ensemble</h2><p>Aubrey Haive came from RuPaul’s Drag Race Down Under season two. Unluckily, she struggled in revealing her wings during Insects on the Runway episode. This slight wardrobe malfunction drove her to the bottom two spot alongside Kween Kong.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Yvie Oddly, Left Behind Tulle</h2><p>In Yvie Oddly’s episode on Werq The World: The Docu-Series season 2, she wore an outfit which is practically wrapped with tulle. Apparently, this didn’t work during the actual performance, inducing other drag queens to rip it apart. However, a piece of tulle was left behind which was accidentally stepped on by Kim Chi, consequently making hell fall down onstage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Akashia, Tripping on her Dress</h2><p>Entering RuPaul’s Drag Race season 1, Akashia was the first drag queen to experience tripping down the runway. As she was strutting onstage, her gown proved to be too long to handle that her booty hit the floor after an awkward misstep. Nevertheless, in true diva fashion, she creatively turned this accident into a wise pose.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Courtney Act, Skirt Slip Up</h2><p>This scene didn’t exactly happen in any season of RuPaul’s Drag Race, drag queen Courtney Act has perhaps endured one of the most epic wardrobe malfunctions. As she was introduced in Celebrity Big Brother, she suddenly tripped on stage and lost her sparkly skirt. This exposed her to near-nudity, showing a large part of her lower body.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Lala Ri, Purple Bag Dress</h2><p>When Lala Ri found out that there would be a sewing challenge, she almost prepared herself to be in the bottom two. To remedy the lack of skill in sewing she decided to glue the paper bags and form it into a dress with a unicorn vibe. As she tried to model the outfit in the runway, her bag dress seemed to be in the brink of getting ripped apart.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Asia O’Hara, Butterfly Massacre</h2><p>Asia O’Hara tried to impress during RuPaul’s Drag Race season 10 finale in her colorful butterfly-inspired costume. She prepared and envisioned the living butterflies to fly out as she reveals them. However, they decided to be uncooperative and crawls across the stage instead.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The-Masked-Singer-Season-8-Semifinals-220x147.jpg alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Recap: Snowstorm Unmasked in Thanksgiving Semifinals" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570ZqlpKGenHq2usWoqaCdpKmuo7jEZq6aqpSnvKOxjKaYpZ6lo7C1tc6nqmannmK%2FtrzArqOsZZSnrqh50Zqanmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
