The music video for the song “Breakdown” went live on September 17. From <a href=#>the teasers shared</a>, I thought G-Eazy and Lovato seem like an unlikely pairing, but this song is seriously sensational. You don’t want to miss this one</strong>!</p><p>“Breakdown” is a song about losing yourself while trying to lead a successful career. The video for this song begins with stills of both G-Eazy and Lovato. Titles from articles written about them are being layered on top of their faces until they cannot be seen. This visual is powerful because it makes the viewer feel like the publicity is what lead them to their “Breakdown.”</p><p>Although I felt like this pairing was unlikely, their names in the headlines were stated in very similar respects. Since they both have very public struggles, they’re the perfect pair to sing this song. If you came here to hear a happy upbeat song, this might not be the track for you.</p><p>The lyrics are by far the strongest part of this song. Lovato’s verses talk about how they’ve lost their self in their career. Whereas G-Eazy raps about how he feels all alone in a dark space. The visuals in this music video are shot perfectly with a wall between the two of them. The wall between them helps draw a parallel to the fact that they’re feeling very similarly alone.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>They aren’t seen without a wall separating them until the end of the video when they’re under a bridge. While they’re under the bridge, they’re singing about being in the heart of the storm. This could be the seen as the deepest part of the “Breakdown.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-praise-them-for-being-vulnerable-in-their-music>Fans Praise Them For Being Vulnerable In Their Music</h2><p>Lovato has a history of being extremely vulnerable in their recent music career. Their whole last album Dancing With The Devil: The Art Of Starting Over is about their drug overdose and social struggles. On top of their album, Lovato also has a YouTube documentary series, along with <a href=#>a podcast</a> and new <a href=#>talk show</a>. Considering they’ve done all of that so recently, I’m sure that’s why G-Eazy chose to work with them for this single.</p><p>“It’s hard to see a song with a meaningful message like this these days, I love to see artists who aren’t afraid of showing their truth,” said a fan in the YouTube comments.</p><p>The message behind this song is extremely meaningful. It talks about how although they’re practically in center stage for their entire life, they’re trying to remain who they are. In recent months, Lovato has made many moves to feel more comfortable while in the public eye. This began with their <a href=#>non-binary announcement</a>, continued with them coming out as pansexual, and has continued on through their hairstyle and the way they dress.</p><p>In the past few months, Lovato has shown that they have an incredible amount of courage. What they’re doing (and talking about) isn’t easy, and I’m sure being in the public eye makes it even harder. Since they’ve done so much to ensure their true story is heard, it’s obvious that they will always continue with that. They’ve gone through some extremely hard times in the public eye. Although they probably felt “Breakdown”s arising, they came off as someone who wants to share their story. Their story is delicate, but one that has the possibility to save thousands in the long run.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1204087209.jpeg alt="98 Degrees Heats It Up With Remix EP of ‘Summer of ’98’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>demi lovato</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w56komWcpMOiwM5mnmadka%2FGbrDRqKdmpaWotqR51aKbnqddm7yzeceemKuslpq5tXnTrqWeZZKnsqK3w6iup2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
