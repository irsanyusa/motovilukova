In&nbsp;the cities, everyone takes to&nbsp;the streets. Balconies and rooftops of&nbsp;houses are full of&nbsp;people staring at&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Moon data-link=tag>Moon</a> in&nbsp;shock. It’s red. Some people scream that it’s the end of&nbsp;the world; some seek shelter.</p><p>Indeed, the usual white Moon now looks like it&nbsp;has been doused in&nbsp;red paint. There’s no&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;afraid if&nbsp;you see such a&nbsp;thing. On&nbsp;the contrary, enjoy the view, because you have witnessed a&nbsp;rare astronomical phenomenon. This is&nbsp;a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>total lunar eclipse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/818/3bc/44c487566c9777aa83aa270ec9.png><p>Here’s the <a href=# title=Sun data-link=tag>Sun</a>; it’s in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;our <a href=# title="solar system" data-link=tag>solar system</a>. <a href=# title=Mercury data-link=tag>Mercury</a>, <a href=# title=Venus data-link=tag>Venus</a>, and here’s <a href=# title=Earth data-link=tag>Earth</a> and the Moon. The Earth takes 365 days to&nbsp;orbit around the star. At&nbsp;the same time, the Moon revolves around the Earth and completely orbits our planet in&nbsp;27&nbsp;days. The Earth creates a&nbsp;shadow zone, and sometimes the Moon passes through&nbsp;it. The shadow is&nbsp;cone-shaped and gradually narrows.</p><p>The Moon is&nbsp;238,000&nbsp;mi [(384,000&nbsp;km)] away. That’s like 9&nbsp;lengths of&nbsp;the equator. At&nbsp;this distance, the width of&nbsp;the shadow is&nbsp;about 2.6 times the width of&nbsp;the Moon. When the Moon is&nbsp;in&nbsp;this zone, direct sunlight doesn’t reach&nbsp;it. That&nbsp;is, it&nbsp;should’ve disappeared, but instead, it&nbsp;becomes red.</p><p>All because the Sun’s rays pass through the Earth’s <a href=# title=atmosphere data-link=tag>atmosphere</a>. They scatter, and most of&nbsp;the blue light disappears. But the red and orange rays continue and hit the surface of&nbsp;the Moon. Voilà! You see a&nbsp;phenomenon called the blood Moon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/dfe/818/8542c05471ab9099068189e15c.png><p>By&nbsp;the way, this curvature of&nbsp;light occurs at&nbsp;sunsets and dawns. The atmosphere scatters the blue light, and you see a&nbsp;red and orange sky. If&nbsp;you were standing on&nbsp;the surface of&nbsp;the Moon during a&nbsp;total lunar eclipse, planet Earth would be&nbsp;exactly between you and the Sun. So&nbsp;you would be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;observe the solar eclipse.</p><p>The surface of&nbsp;the Earth would become entirely dark for you. All you’d see would be&nbsp;the Sun’s corona illuminating the edges of&nbsp;the planet. The Earth from the surface of&nbsp;the Moon is&nbsp;almost the same size as&nbsp;the Moon from the surface of&nbsp;the Earth. Such a&nbsp;red eclipse of&nbsp;the Moon is&nbsp;rare because several factors must coincide. One of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;that the Moon must be&nbsp;full. Usually, you can see two total lunar eclipses a&nbsp;year.</p><p>In&nbsp;2038, you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see 4&nbsp;such eclipses. And the eclipse itself can last up&nbsp;to&nbsp;108&nbsp;minutes. But this is&nbsp;rare, and the last time such a&nbsp;long blood moon was seen was in&nbsp;2000. Many years ago, people didn’t know so&nbsp;many facts about our satellite, and the sight of&nbsp;a&nbsp;red moon frightened them. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bad sign and a&nbsp;harbinger of&nbsp;trouble. People who knew the schedule of&nbsp;eclipses could take advantage of&nbsp;it.</p><p>For example, Christopher Columbus had an&nbsp;astronomical almanac and knew when the next lunar eclipse would occur. He&nbsp;frightened the inhabitants of&nbsp;the Caribbean islands when he&nbsp;“predicted” the red Moon. Once upon a&nbsp;time, the Moon used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;red ball of&nbsp;lava. This was way back in&nbsp;time, 4.5 billion years ago. This is&nbsp;our solar system. It’s full of&nbsp;dust and asteroids. They’re constantly bumping into each other, playing space billiards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/205/ab9/9d67cb5325a574ef4f88b509f7.png><p>This is&nbsp;Earth. It’s just beginning to&nbsp;cool off from the constant asteroid and comet impacts. But then Theia appears on&nbsp;the horizon. A&nbsp;planet the size of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Mars data-link=tag>Mars</a>. It&nbsp;had a&nbsp;chaotic orbit and was approaching Earth in&nbsp;a&nbsp;spiral.</p><p>A&nbsp;collision was inevitable, and at&nbsp;one point, one of&nbsp;the biggest crashes in&nbsp;our solar system occurred. Theia struck the Earth at&nbsp;an&nbsp;angle. It&nbsp;ripped out part of&nbsp;the Earth’s crust and threw it&nbsp;into space. The Earth, in&nbsp;turn, absorbed part of&nbsp;the planet that rammed&nbsp;it. The debris from the collision circled the Earth for a&nbsp;long time. They were a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;<a href=# title=ring data-link=tag>ring</a>, almost like Saturn’s.</p><p>Debris in&nbsp;orbit collided and piled up&nbsp;around a&nbsp;common center of&nbsp;gravity. And that’s how the Earth got the Moon. There’s a&nbsp;theory that this collision helped give birth to&nbsp;life on&nbsp;our planet. Theia hit the Earth at&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect angle. If&nbsp;the crash had been head-on, both planets would likely have been destroyed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;massive explosion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/10a/f37/e0be6b5212acd2a34d3ef2d993.png><p>If&nbsp;the impact had been tangential, then there wouldn’t have been enough debris in&nbsp;Earth’s orbit to&nbsp;form the Moon. But we&nbsp;got the lucky ticket. The Moon stabilized the Earth’s rotation. The collision shattered the planet’s solid crust and allowed oceans to&nbsp;form. Remember? <a href=# title=Water data-link=tag>Water</a> is&nbsp;the basis of&nbsp;life. When the cores of&nbsp;Earth and Theia merged, we&nbsp;got a&nbsp;powerful magnetosphere. This protects all living organisms from solar radiation.</p><p>The Moon, along with the Sun, controls the tides. Its gravity seems to&nbsp;draw water to&nbsp;it&nbsp;from the Earth’s surface. The Sun does the same thing. That&nbsp;is, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;imagine the Earth as&nbsp;a&nbsp;ball of&nbsp;water, there would be&nbsp;two mountains, one on&nbsp;the Moon’s side and one on&nbsp;the Sun’s side. And as&nbsp;the Moon moves around the Earth, this mountain of&nbsp;water moves with&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;you were in&nbsp;the open ocean with a&nbsp;tape measure, you would see that the Moon is&nbsp;attracting water to&nbsp;itself by&nbsp;about 4-6 in&nbsp;[(10-15&nbsp;cm)].</p><p>The Moon is&nbsp;gravitationally locked with the Earth. That’s why it&nbsp;is&nbsp;always turned to&nbsp;us with one side, like Mercury and the Sun. But the Moon doesn’t stand still. It’s gradually moving away from our planet. About&nbsp;1.5 in&nbsp;[(4&nbsp;cm)] a&nbsp;year. Not quickly, but in&nbsp;about 600 million years, it&nbsp;will have shrunk in&nbsp;our sky so&nbsp;much that we&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see lunar eclipses anymore. Do&nbsp;you see this crater?</p><p>It’s Tycho. It’s visible during a&nbsp;full moon because of&nbsp;these bright rays that extend thousands of&nbsp;miles from its epicenter. This is&nbsp;the youngest crater on&nbsp;the Moon. Scientists say it&nbsp;appeared there due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;meteorite impact about 109 million years ago. At&nbsp;that time, dinosaurs were roaming the surface of&nbsp;our planet. And they may have seen the impact. It&nbsp;was most likely accompanied by&nbsp;a&nbsp;big explosion and looked like a&nbsp;salute in&nbsp;the night sky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/162/e3c/14c1a65efebb8e33aa18246ead.png><p>Humanity loves to&nbsp;explore the Moon. We’ve sent a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;missions there. A&nbsp;total of&nbsp;12&nbsp;people have set foot on&nbsp;the surface of&nbsp;the Moon. The gravitational force there is&nbsp;6&nbsp;times less than on&nbsp;Earth. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;the average person on&nbsp;our planet weighed about 180&nbsp;lb [(80&nbsp;kg)], on&nbsp;the surface of&nbsp;the Moon the scales would only show 30&nbsp;lb [(13&nbsp;kg)]. Like the weight of&nbsp;an&nbsp;average dog.</p><p>That’s why the astronauts moved, jumped, and fell so&nbsp;strangely there. And you would be&nbsp;6&nbsp;times stronger on&nbsp;the surface of&nbsp;the Moon. Here on&nbsp;Earth, the average person could lift about 130&nbsp;lb [(60&nbsp;kg)]. But on&nbsp;the Moon, you could raise a&nbsp;big motorcycle. Or&nbsp;a&nbsp;grizzly bear.</p><p>The surface of&nbsp;the Moon is&nbsp;covered with regolith. This is&nbsp;the lunar dust that covers the solid ground. Such dust is&nbsp;good at&nbsp;preserving footprints. Here is&nbsp;the most famous footprint, which gave birth to&nbsp;many crazy theories. Here’s the footprint, and here’s the shoe that left&nbsp;it. But the shoe is&nbsp;completely flat! This is&nbsp;explained simply: the astronauts wore extra boots for walking on&nbsp;the lunar surface.</p><p>They have exactly the kind of&nbsp;sole that left these marks. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the footprints, we&nbsp;left many fascinating objects on&nbsp;the Moon. Several lunar rovers. A&nbsp;golf ball, flags, and human waste. There are also a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;broken satellites and rocket parts. All in&nbsp;all, about 413,000 pounds of&nbsp;human-made objects are there. That’s the weight of&nbsp;3&nbsp;passenger planes. Or&nbsp;31&nbsp;adult elephants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/aef/2c1/a360cd5f8991eace395d1262a9.png><p>In&nbsp;the future, we&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;resume missions to&nbsp;the Moon. New landers will explore the surface of&nbsp;our satellite to&nbsp;find natural resources there. It’s also a&nbsp;great place to&nbsp;test new rovers. We’re even going to&nbsp;build something like the International Space Station in&nbsp;the Moon’s orbit. The Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway.</p><p>It’ll be&nbsp;a&nbsp;convenient platform for exploring our satellite and launching spacecraft into distant space. If&nbsp;you start from here, the spacecraft won’t need to&nbsp;spend almost all its fuel to&nbsp;overcome the force of&nbsp;Earth’s gravity. So&nbsp;such a&nbsp;station would save fuel and money.</p><p>Scientists hope that we’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;mine water from the Moon’s surface. It’s been proven that there’s ice there. Mostly at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;craters where the sunlight doesn’t reach. Perhaps we’ll send a&nbsp;rover there that can drill down a&nbsp;few feet into the surface, searching for water.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/dbe/1ea/32f4355470bbb95544d972cbc5.png><p>Humanity already has the technology to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;full-fledged colony there. It&nbsp;would take up&nbsp;to&nbsp;three days to&nbsp;get there. We&nbsp;just need to&nbsp;get enough solar panels and building materials to&nbsp;the Moon. There’s no&nbsp;atmosphere on&nbsp;the Moon. So&nbsp;potential lunar inhabitants would be&nbsp;defenseless against solar radiation.</p><p>We&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;build houses underground to&nbsp;provide protection. Modern 3D&nbsp;printers will help make construction easy and fast. However, food and water supplies can only be&nbsp;maintained by&nbsp;constant supplies from Earth. The same goes for oxygen. Each rocket launch costs millions of&nbsp;dollars, so&nbsp;for now, colonization of&nbsp;the Moon is&nbsp;in&nbsp;question.</p><p>The Moon could also become an&nbsp;object for space tourism. Imagine&nbsp;— A&nbsp;spaceship launches from Earth, three days on&nbsp;the road, and you’re orbiting the Moon. The lunar module undocks, and you land on&nbsp;the surface. You ride the rover, explore the craters, then return to&nbsp;the lander. The engines start, the lander returns you to&nbsp;orbit, you dock with the ship and return to&nbsp;Earth. Sounds like some pretty great plans for a&nbsp;week’s vacation.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWmvsSsZLCgkal6tbuMnaZmoZZixrDBjKycnmWknbJuvsSdZKann6N6eX2ScG9pZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
