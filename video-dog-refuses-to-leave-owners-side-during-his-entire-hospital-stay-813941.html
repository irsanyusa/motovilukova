And let’s face it&nbsp;— dogs are just incredible creatures. Whether they’re providing comfort, assistance, or&nbsp;simply a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;safety, these furry heroes embody the very best of&nbsp;humanity. Just look at&nbsp;Magnus, one of&nbsp;the best service dogs we’ve ever seen.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the hospital for a&nbsp;check-up.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5dc/1d6/b7d4755d4fbf836150f33ea92e.jpg><p>For Brian Benson, it&nbsp;all started with sudden chest pains and difficulty breathing. He&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the&nbsp;ER to&nbsp;get checked out, and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, doctors kept him for 3&nbsp;days, running countless tests, observing his condition, and monitoring his heart.</p><p>Unfortunately, the prognosis was dire, and doctors discovered he&nbsp;had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cardiomyopathy</a>. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;word, his heart was weak due to&nbsp;blocked arteries, and it&nbsp;all was linked to&nbsp;his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> history of&nbsp;heart disease and heart attacks, especially at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;was leading a&nbsp;healthy life, but as&nbsp;he&nbsp;said, “You can’t beat genetics.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/584/c56/1e233a5a80bc4f8358dd8ff39a.jpg><p>Brian had been working out for over 35&nbsp;years, eating healthily, completing multiple Spartan races, running the NYC marathon, and so&nbsp;on. And yet he’s one of&nbsp;those rare cases when a&nbsp;person “just” develops cardiomyopathy.</p><p>“The painful reality is&nbsp;that sometimes you just can’t beat your genetics, no&nbsp;matter how hard you work. It’s almost like trying to&nbsp;swim upstream&nbsp;— maximum effort with minimal or&nbsp;limited results,” he&nbsp;wrote on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>. However, he&nbsp;believed he&nbsp;was fortunate to&nbsp;have friends, family, and his boy, Magnus, when he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>needed</a> them most.</p><p><h2>His family and friends were always ready to&nbsp;help during visiting hours.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/914/884/f187bb5a188a95a7b582cd71a7.jpg><p>His daughters stayed with him all 3&nbsp;days he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a>. They ensured he&nbsp;was comfortable and had enough pillows and enough “yummy food to&nbsp;eat.” “They really stepped up&nbsp;and did EVERYTHING for&nbsp;me,” said Brian.</p><p>He&nbsp;was also grateful to&nbsp;his friends who stood in&nbsp;his corner, helping in&nbsp;any way possible. He&nbsp;has known many of&nbsp;them since childhood and others since the 3rd, 4th, &&nbsp;5th grades. They’ve become a&nbsp;family for him, and they all checked in&nbsp;with him constantly to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was okay or&nbsp;needed their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>help</a>.</p><p><h2>But the only friend who was allowed to&nbsp;stay after visiting hours was Magnus.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/637/561/c7b04a57efbf9f29d02f931178.jpg><p>Brian’s family and friends were not allowed to&nbsp;stay with him after <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>visiting hours</a>. Thankfully, doctors allowed Magnus, his service dog, to&nbsp;stay with him 24/7, and that added a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;all that overwhelming outpouring of&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> and support that his relatives had already surrounded him with.</p><p>Magnus did precisely what he&nbsp;does best. He&nbsp;kept Brian relaxed and took his mind off the current situation, which is&nbsp;crucial for anyone with such a&nbsp;severe condition. He&nbsp;knew when to&nbsp;cuddle and when to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;little “goofy.” And he&nbsp;made the medical staff smile as&nbsp;well. “I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>love</a> this dog more than he&nbsp;will ever know.”</p><p><h2>Brian and Magnus became a&nbsp;local pet therapy team.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fa/431/97378e53d28be9ebf37ee4cbc5.jpg><p>Now, they visit hospitals to&nbsp;comfort terminally ill children and adults. They also see their grieving families and do&nbsp;not forget about the overworked hospital staff who do&nbsp;everything possible to&nbsp;help their patients.</p><p>The team works with children who have severe learning disabilities and emotional disorders as&nbsp;well. And to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that, Magnus has to&nbsp;“shine” with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>empathy</a>. He&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;natural ability to&nbsp;read people and understand all their needs in&nbsp;the moment. Magnus is&nbsp;just the right dog to&nbsp;do&nbsp;all these things and bring everyone smiles, joy, and love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/204/4f1/be53da54fd8ab7299582e0a179.jpg><p>“Everyone who encounters Magnus cannot help but smile and feel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>relaxed</a>. He&nbsp;has a&nbsp;calming nature about him that relieves any stress or&nbsp;anxiety you may have, and he&nbsp;always makes you feel at&nbsp;ease,” their official website reads. And hopefully, many people share their values and motto: “Life is&nbsp;better <a href=#>with a&nbsp;dog</a>”!</p><p><h2>VIDEO: Magnus, the therapy dog, taking care of&nbsp;his human friend during his entire hospital stay.</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMOqsMSoZJ2nl2K%2FprLUrJysZaSkeq2xwK%2BcZqeno7Kzv4ysoJ2dXZnCs7XNoGShoaNisq%2FAyKucZqCfqL2qwMClZKyska56eX2ScmtqZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
