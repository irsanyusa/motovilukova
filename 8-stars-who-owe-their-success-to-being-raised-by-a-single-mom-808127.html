And there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;doubt that playing the role of&nbsp;both mom and dad is&nbsp;an&nbsp;exhausting challenge for any parent. But it&nbsp;might also help create deeper bonds between them and their children.</p><p>After all, when a&nbsp;child sees that their mom is&nbsp;navigating through life’s struggles to&nbsp;raise them by&nbsp;herself, they’ll feel extra <a href=# title=motivated data-link=tag>motivated</a> to&nbsp;succeed. And they’ll also learn that by&nbsp;being independent and hard-working, anything can be&nbsp;achieved.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> admires those superhero single moms who are the picture of&nbsp;devotion and strength. And here are 8&nbsp;celebs who know that it’s their self-relying single mamas who inspired them to&nbsp;become the stars they are today.</p><p><h2>Irmelin Indenbirken&nbsp;— Leonardo DiCaprio’s mother</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa6/b85/cb14af53fb924f67006bf08764.jpg><p>The <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>star</a>’s parents were already <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>separated</a> by&nbsp;the time he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;year old, and he&nbsp;was raised by&nbsp;his mom, whom he&nbsp;calls ’’a walking miracle.’’ The mother-son duo is&nbsp;incredibly close, and for more than 2&nbsp;decades, DiCaprio had been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>taking</a> his mom to&nbsp;major red carpet events. The actor once revealed that he&nbsp;owes his brilliant success to&nbsp;none other than his mama, saying, “I&nbsp;would not be&nbsp;standing up&nbsp;here if&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn’t for this person.”</p><p>And it’s obvious that Indenbirken will forever hold a&nbsp;central place in&nbsp;DiCaprio’s heart, and that no&nbsp;other woman can take&nbsp;it. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;fact, when once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> when the last time he&nbsp;bought a&nbsp;diamond for a&nbsp;girl was, the Hollywood heartthrob replied, “My&nbsp;mom is&nbsp;the only person that&nbsp;I would buy something like that for.”</p><p><h2>Mary May Smith&nbsp;— Pierce Brosnan’s mother</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e5/4e1/1ce90751d186b569e6e740e7bd.jpg><p>The 69-year-old <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actor</a> has admitted to&nbsp;being ’’an only child from a&nbsp;fractured family.’’ He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> that his father ’’took off very early’’ and that his mom left home when he&nbsp;was 4. However, she returned later&nbsp;on, and they moved to&nbsp;London. Brosnan revealed that his mom was very supportive and that she always told him to ’’follow your dreams.’’</p><p><h2>Judith Ann Hawkins&nbsp;— Halle Berry’s mother</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e5c/ee5/b2e5f459e68a483727b57c45c1.jpg><p>EVERETT COLLECTION/EAST NEWS</p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actress</a> and her sister were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>raised</a> by&nbsp;their mom after she had left their dad.
