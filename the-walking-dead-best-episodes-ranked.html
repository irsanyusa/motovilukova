Just ask the characters on AMC’s iconic zombie series “The Walking Dead” if you have any doubt about that. For 11 gory seasons, they routinely bid farewell to friends and family who were consumed by flesh-eating corpses, slaughtered by roving bands of maniacs, butchered by cannibalistic psychos and annihilated by armed militias.</p><p>But with “The Walking Dead” officially ending on Nov. 20, it’s time for the show’s millions of viewers to say good-bye, at least for now, to beloved characters like Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan) and Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan).</p><p>Thankfully, fans can look forward to several upcoming spinoffs, including “The Walking Dead: Dead City,” which is scheduled to launch in April 2023. Until then, many devoted viewers will rewatch their favorite episodes of the series that started it all. For some, that will mean going back to the show’s early seasons set on Hershel’s farm and the prison. Others will return to the Terminus episodes and the group’s arrival at Alexandria. And more than a few will choose to replay the epic wars with the Saviors and the Whisperers.</p><p>To help you wade through the more than 170 blood-drenched episodes of “The Walking Dead,” Variety has selected and ranked the best 40 episodes from the entire series. So sharpen your Samurai sword, crack open a massive can of chocolate pudding, and get ready for a stroll down nightmare lane.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The Storm</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/40.-The-Storm.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Season 9, Episode 16</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Considering how many years “The Walking Dead” has covered, it’s surprising how infrequently weather has factored into the series. Aside from an occasional wind or rain storm, seasonal climate conditions almost never impact the world the characters exist in. But that changed dramatically in the final episode of Season 9, when a massive blizzard forced the fleeing residents of the Kingdom to battle the elements as they trekked through Whisperer territory. In terms of sheer spectacle, “The Storm” is one of the most visually impressive episodes in the series, and often looks like a big budget action movie. As an added bonus, Negan gets to show his heroic side when he risks his life to rescue Judith after she runs off to save Dog.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>On the Inside</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/39.-On-the-Inside.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Season 11, Episode 6</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Fans of the legendary horror filmmaker Wes Craven will appreciate this freaky episode which functions, in part, as a loving homage to his claustrophobic 1991 classic “The People Under the Stairs.” Half of the episode finds Connie and Virgil pursued through the walls of a spooky mansion by a group of ravenous cannibals who’ve been driven insane by the end of the world. Meanwhile, Daryl is forced to torture a friend in order to protect the secret location of Maggie’s hideout. Juggling two intense storylines, director Greg Nicotero once again proves that no one knows how to wring maximum suspense out of “The Walking Dead” quite like he does.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>We Are the End of the World</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/38.-We-Are-the-End-of-the-World.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Season 10, Episode 2</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This episode doesn’t advance the overarching story, but it does offer an intriguing look at the Whisperers’ bizarre culture of dominance and submission. When a power struggle between Alpha and one of her masked minions boils over into bloodshed, Gamma steps in to rescue her leader, thus earning a position of respect for herself in the process. The fact that she willingly kills her own sister to achieve that goal makes it clear just how twisted the Whisperers’ philosophy is. The most illuminating element of this episode, however, is the ghoulish flashback sequence that reveals how Alpha and Lydia first met Beta.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>No Other Way</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/37.-No-Other-Way.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Season 11, Episode 9</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Compared to the Saviors and the Whisperers, the Reapers never quite lived up to their fearsome reputation. But the conclusion of their storyline in Season 11 made for one hell of an exciting episode. Opening with a white-knuckle cat and mouse game between Maggie’s exhausted team and Leah’s squad of highly trained mercenaries, the violent showdown reaches a memorable end when Leah radios for her sniper, Jenson, to open fire on Maggie and her friends, only to hear a voice on the walkie-talkie reply, “Nope, no Jenson here. Call me Gabriel.” It’s the kind of blood-pumping moment that “The Walking Dead” excels at. In fact, that particular line from Gabriel proved to be so popular with viewers, it was quoted on an official Walking Dead T-shirt soon after the episode aired.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Scars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_914_gp_1022_0648_rt.jpg><p>Season 9, Episode 14</p><p>When her old college friend unexpectedly arrives at Alexandria with a group of frightened children in desperate need of food and protection, a pregnant Michonne unwisely lets her guard down and invites them inside. It’s an impulsive decision that she (barely) lives to regret. Although killer kids are a somewhat familiar trope on the series, this disturbing episode showcases one of Danai Gurira’s most intense performances, and includes a climactic massacre scene that left many viewers genuinely shocked. As the demented Jocelyn, Michonne’s deadly former school chum, “True Blood” star Rutina Wesley brings new meaning to the term frenemy.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The Cell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_702_gp_0523_0392-rt.jpg><p>Season 7, Episode 3</p><p>Locked in a small, dark cell in the bowels of the Sanctuary, Daryl struggles to maintain his core humanity while being physically, mentally, and emotionally tortured by Dwight at Negan’s cruel command. Stripped naked and beaten mercilessly as a cheerful song plays over and over again on an endless loop, the harrowing humiliations that Daryl endures in this grueling episode are deeply unpleasant to watch, but they inform every move and decision that the character makes in the series from this point on. For the full “Walking Dead” fan experience, be sure to eat a (fake) dog food sandwich while watching this episode. According to actor Norman Reedus, the dog food sandwiches that he ate in the actual episode were made from ground Spam, but corned beef hash should work just as well in a pinch. Bon appétit!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The Well</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_703_gp_0525_0233-rt.jpg><p>Season 7, Episode 2</p><p>After being shot several times during a Savior attack, Carol recuperates at a strange new community called The Kingdom, where she meets the flamboyant ruler known as King Ezekiel, and his pet Bengal tiger named Shiva. A transformative episode that expands the series’ post-apocalyptic world into something that more closely resembles the epic fantasy subgenre, “The Well” is best summed up by Carol’s hilariously incredulous line, “I don’t know what the hell is going on in the most wonderful way!”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Open Your Eyes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/33.-Open-Your-Eyes.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Season 10, Episode 7</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Still suffering from severe PTSD after witnessing the slaughter of Enid, Tara, Henry, and more at the end of Season 9, Siddiq finally realizes that awkward newcomer Dante isn’t the lovable goofball he seems to be. Instead, he’s a Whisperer spy who’s been gathering intelligence on the Alexandrians and thwarting them from within. Unfortunately, Dante gets the upper hand on Siddiq before he can alert the others. Directed with stylish precision by former cast member Michael Cudlitz, “Open Your Eyes” ends on one of the biggest downers of the entire series. In a way, it’s almost a relief that Carl Grimes, who gave his life bringing Siddiq to Alexandria, didn’t live long enough to see his friend’s tragic fate.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The World Before</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/32.-The-World-Before.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Season 10, Episode 8</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Picking up mere seconds after the tragic ending of “Open Your Eyes,” this episode begins with quite possibly the most nerve-shredding fight scene in Walking Dead history as Rosita confronts the murderous Dante while literally holding baby Coco in her arms. With the ferocity of a lioness defending her cub, Rosita whups Dante’s butt while simultaneously protecting her infant from the jaws of a newly reanimated Siddiq. Later, Gabriel visits Dante in his prison cell, and after delivering a powerful monologue about second chances, stabs him to death in a cathartic explosion of rage and vengeance. Directed by acclaimed feature filmmaker John Dahl, “The World Before” is the type of episode that leaves you shaking by the time the credits roll.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Here's Not Here</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_604_gp_0730_0279.jpg><p>Season 6, Episode 4</p><p>This 90-minute character-driven episode is crucial to understanding Morgan’s stubborn belief that all life is precious. In a long flashback, Morgan recalls meeting a man named Eastman, who was a psychiatrist before the world ended. Now a devout student of Aikido, Eastman teaches Morgan the way of the peaceful warrior, and offers him lessons on how to fight using a traditional bō staff. As the enigmatic Eastman, actor John Carroll Lynch delivers the kind of stellar performance that makes one wish he was cast in benevolent roles more often, rather than the menacing characters he typically portrays in thrillers like “Zodiac” and “The Invitation.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>What’s Been Lost</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/30.-Whats-Been-Lost.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Season 11, Episode 20</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In a season disappointingly light on physical action, this pedal-to-the-metal episode is a welcome return to form. Fans of Melissa McBride’s seasoned warrior Carol Peletier no doubt enjoyed seeing her team up with Daryl to bust the slithery Lance Hornsby out of the Commonwealth prison. Watching Carol battle armed guards and ravenous walkers without ever breaking a sweat was a real treat, and seeing a zombified Sebastian wriggle around on a gore-covered floor like a pathetic monster was even better. Pamela Milton, meanwhile, is at her most villainous as she blackmails Yumiko to do her bidding. But it’s the episode’s delicious final moment, where Lance gets what’s coming to him, that makes “What’s Been Lost” one of the best shows of Season 11.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Last Day on Earth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_616_gp_1116_0127-rt.jpg><p>Season 6, Episode 16</p><p>No other episode of “The Walking Dead” captures the feeling of mounting dread better than this inexorable descent into Hell. When pregnancy complications threaten the life of Maggie and her unborn baby, Rick and his crew hop in the Winnebago and race to Hilltop to get her some much needed medical aid. But each route they take is blocked by Saviors, until they find themselves with nowhere left to run. Eventually, they’re forced to their knees as the notorious Negan makes his long-awaited first appearance on the show. The sinister game of “eeny, meeny, miny, moe” that ends this special 90-minute episode is one of the darkest moments in the series’ history.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Walk With Me</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_gp_303_0604_0300.jpg><p>Season 3, Episode 3</p><p>Long before Negan and Alpha began terrorizing Rick and his friends, there was the Governor to contend with. In “Walk with Me,” Michonne and Andrea are captured by a roving band of thugs led by Daryl’s missing brother Merle, now sporting a do-it-yourself bayonet strapped to the stump where his hand used to be. Taken to the fortified town of Woodbury, they’re introduced to Philip Blake, aka the Governor, whose charming outward appearance masks a power-mad obsession with law and order. The fact that he also keeps a collection of twitchy walker heads floating in aquariums in his gloomy man cave is cause for concern, but then again nobody’s perfect.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Here’s Negan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/27.-Heres-Negan.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Season 10, Episode 22</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The six episodes of Season 10 that were shot during the pandemic were a mixed bag in terms of storytelling. The exception, however, was the final episode, which fills in Negan’s background and provides Jeffrey Dean Morgan with some truly powerful scenes to explore. Appearing in flashbacks, Hilarie Burton-Morgan – Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s real-life wife – portrays Negan’s doomed spouse Lucille, and her inspired casting adds an extra layer of depth to an already memorable episode. Beautifully directed by Laura Belsey, this emotionally raw and revealing hour of television deepens our understanding of one of TV’s most frightening villains, showing us the man behind the monster. Be sure to keep a box of Kleenex handy, because this episode is guaranteed to make you cry</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Hearts Still Beating</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_708_gp_0728_0279-rt.jpg><p>Season 7, Episode 8</p><p>The first half of Season 7 was unquestionably the most brutal and depressing string of episodes in the history of the franchise, with our heroes facing one bloody defeat after another. Their miserable fates began to improve, however, in the appropriately titled “Hearts Still Beating.” As if Daryl’s triumphant escape from the confines of the Sanctuary wasn’t cheerful enough, seeing Negan viciously disembowel deceitful creep Spencer provided fans with a much-needed smile. But it’s the final scene where Rick and his friends regain their mojo and decide to fight back against the Saviors that makes this mid-season finale so invigorating.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Not Tomorrow Yet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_612_gp_0930_0126-rt.jpg><p>Season 6, Episode 12</p><p>Unaware of his enemy’s vast resources, Rick’s cocky plan to preemptively attack one of Negan’s outposts proves to be his worst tactical decision since briefly banishing Carol way back in Season 4. Although the assault on Negan’s satellite compound is loaded with nail-biting suspense and pulse-pounding action, it’s the portentous moment when Glenn notices a gruesome collection of Polaroid snapshots depicting victims with their heads pulverized that lingers in the mind long after the episode is over. Eerily foreshadowing the grisly fate that awaits both Glenn and Abraham, it’s the type of haunting detail that “The Walking Dead” excels at.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The Same Boat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_613_gp_1014_0291-rt.jpg><p>Season 6, Episode 13</p><p>Picking up immediately after the group’s assault on Negan’s outpost, “The Same Boat” finds Carol and Maggie captured by a small band of Saviors, including Paula, one of Negan’s personal lieutenants. This textbook bottle episode is structured much like a gripping stage drama, with Maggie desperately trying to negotiate their release while Carol subtly manipulates her captors into lowering their guard just enough for her to strike. As the cunning (yet oddly sympathetic) Paula, actress Alicia Witt delivers an impressively nuanced performance. Too bad that she gets her face chewed off in the show’s gloriously revolting last few minutes. It might have been nice to see her stick around and torment Rick’s gang for a little while longer.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Guts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/102_twd_20100622_sg-2552.jpg><p>Season 1, Episode 2</p><p>This early episode is notable for several compelling reasons. First and foremost, it introduced viewers to one of the show’s most beloved main characters; heroic pizza delivery guy Glenn Rhee. It also includes the first appearances of Merle Dixon and Theodore “T-Dog” Douglas, both of whom would go on to play substantial roles in Seasons 1 through 3. Finally, it features the very first example of characters literally coating themselves with rancid walker blood in order to move undetected among the living dead.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Wrath</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_816_gp_1116_0136_rt.jpg><p>Season 8, Episode 16</p><p>The thrilling eighth season finale brought the war between Rick’s team and Negan’s Saviors to a satisfying conclusion, and set the stage for new adventures yet to come. The fact that director Greg Nicotero and writers Scott M. Gimple, Angela Kang, and Matthew Negrete managed to tie up two seasons worth of plot developments in a mere 48 minutes is a testament to their storytelling abilities. Overflowing with cheer-worthy scenes, like Oceanside’s surprise Molotov cocktail attack and Eugene’s plan to secretly sabotage the Saviors’ bullet supply, “Wrath” never loses sight of the series’ essential human drama, particularly in its touching final moments.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Evolution</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_908_gp_0730_0802_rt.jpg><p>Season 9, Episode 8</p><p>This mid-season finale reminded viewers just how frightening “The Walking Dead” can be when it wants to. When Daryl, Jesus, and Aaron notice a large group of walkers behaving strangely, they attempt to lure the herd away, but end up trapped within a walled cemetery overrun by whispering zombies. As night falls, our outnumbered heroes realize that these creatures are unlike anything they’ve faced before. Taking a bit of inspiration from John Carpenter’s “The Fog,” as well as a slew of 1940s Dracula films, “Evolution” is a loving ode to classic horror movies and one of the scariest episodes in the series’ history.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>TS-19</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_20100818_sg-2968.jpg><p>Season 1, Episode 6</p><p>The final episode of the show’s brief first season finds Rick and the gang taking shelter at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta. Unfortunately for them, rather than a sense of safety or a cure for the walker phenomenon, all they discover in the fortified governmental building is a suicidal scientist with his finger on the trigger of a thermobaric bomb. The episode’s high-tech setting offers a welcome change of pace from the generic forests and abandoned warehouses that the characters frequently find themselves in, and the massive explosion that wraps things up is still one of the best special effects in the series.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Clear</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_gp_312_0917_0219.jpg><p>Season 3, Episode 12</p><p>While searching for weapons to fight the Governor, Rick, Carl, and Michonne are almost killed by a mysterious sniper shooting at them from a nearby rooftop. After returning fire, they discover that the sniper is actually Morgan Jones, the first person that Rick encountered after waking from his coma in the show’s premiere episode. Mentally shattered by the death of his son, Morgan has gone off the deep end and now spends his days clearing the surrounding area of walkers. Portraying Morgan as a man who’s become dangerously unglued from reality, series regular Lennie James has never been better than he is in “Clear.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Beside the Dying Fire</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_213_1115_4025.jpg><p>Season 2, Episode 13</p><p>Every so often “The Walking Dead” rips its storyline up and basically starts anew, and this second season finale ripped things up exceedingly well. When a horde of walkers invades Hershel’s farm, Rick and his crew retreat into the night as the world around them goes up in flames. Several of Hershel’s friends are killed during the horrific attack, and Rick informs the survivors of a secret that he learned at the CDC: each of them is already infected with a pathogen that will turn them into walkers when they die. Meanwhile, Andrea encounters a hooded figure wielding a now-familiar katana, and the episode ends with a glimpse of the prison which will soon become an important location in the “Walking Dead” universe.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Conquer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_516_gp_1120_0396.jpg><p>Season 5, Episode 16</p><p>Jam-packed with one great moment after another, “Conquer” is a perfectly paced episode that rewards repeated viewings. From the tense pre-title sequence where Morgan battles two members of the Wolves by himself, to Sasha napping in a grave filled with dead walkers, to sniveling coward Nicholas shooting Glenn in the shoulder, to Rick and Carol deviously plotting to take Alexandria by force if they have to, every scene in this expanded 90-minute episode crackles with energy. But it’s the final few seconds that will take your breath away. If hearing Deanna command Rick to execute Pete with a terse “Do it” doesn’t get your blood pumping, you might be a walker yourself.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Honor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_809_gp_0825_0217_rt.jpg><p>Season 8, Episode 9</p><p>Having watched child actor Chandler Riggs virtually grow up on camera over the course of eight seasons, it’s no wonder that his character’s tragic death in this mid-season premiere hit fans so hard. Director Greg Nicotero and writers Matthew Negrete and Channing Powell give Carl an emotional sendoff that’s more than worthy of his status on the show, and cast members Andrew Lincoln and Danai Gurira bring their heartbreaking scenes to life with grace and sensitivity. But what makes “Honor” such a memorable episode is that it also contains some wonderful gross-out moments, like Morgan literally shoving his entire hand inside an enemy’s gaping belly wound and yanking his intestines out as though clearing a clogged drain.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Better Angels</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_212_1103_0703gn.jpg><p>Season 2, Episode 12</p><p>The doomed love triangle between Rick, Lori, and Shane comes to a bloody end in Season 2’s penultimate episode. After murdering the captive Randall in a fit of psychotic rage, Shane manipulates the group into splitting up so that he can get Rick alone and shoot him once and for all. But Rick’s police instincts kick in at the last possible second and he manages to stab his former partner in the chest before Shane can fire a round. Carl gets in on the action, too, with a surprise shot to the reanimated Shane’s head. In many ways, “Better Angels” plays like a classic daytime soap opera, albeit one filled with flesh-eating ghouls.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Four Walls and a Roof</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_503_gp_0603_0493.jpg><p>Season 5, Episode 3</p><p>“Tainted meat!” That’s what Bob shouts hysterically at a pack of hungry Terminus cannibals who are busy snacking on his infected leg right in front of him. It’s one of several deliciously macabre details that make this blackly comic episode such a kick. Aching to take their revenge on Rick and his team, Terminus head honcho Gareth (marvelously played by Andrew J. West) attempts to lure the group away from the safety of Father Gabriel’s church in order to kill them. But Rick turns the tables on the Termites and viciously slaughters them with his trademark red-handled machete as they beg for their lives. Despite its ghastly plot and grotesque imagery, “Four Walls and a Roof” ends on a somber note as Bob says goodbye to the group forever.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>JSS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_602_gp_0518_0110.jpg><p>Season 6, Episode 2</p><p>Proving yet again that she’s a one-woman army, Carol takes matters into her own hands when a group of murderous Wolves attack Alexandria while Rick and the others are away on a scouting mission. After donning a filthy Wolf coat and rubbing a bloody “W” on her forehead as a quick disguise, Carol unleashes holy hell on the rampaging psychos. Meanwhile, a flashback fills viewers in on how Enid originally arrived at Alexandria’s gates. Apparently, she survived on her own by eating raw turtle, which we’re shown in gory detail. Note to Enid: cook your slow-moving reptile next time!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Too Far Gone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_408_gp_0730_0126.jpg><p>Season 4, Episode 8</p><p>After tricking a new group of followers into believing that Rick and his friends are a threat to their lives, the Governor rolls up to the prison in a fully-loaded combat tank with Michonne and Hershel held as hostages. Although Rick pleads for a peaceful coexistence between the two communities, the Governor presses his point by hacking Hershel’s head off with Michonne’s katana. This shocking act of violence ignites one of the series’ fiercest battles. But, honestly, what else would you expect from a one-eyed madman who keeps his 12-year old zombified daughter chained in a cage for his own sick amusement?</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>A Certain Doom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11.-A-Certain-Doom.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Season 10, Episode 16</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Despite its ominous title, “A Certain Doom” is one of the most hopeful episodes of Season 10, thanks in large part to the long-awaited return of Maggie, who arrives in the nick of time to save Gabriel from a group of bloodthirsty Whisperers. But the good news doesn’t end there for our heroes. With the odds stacked against them, Daryl and Negan team up to kill Beta in a gory fight to the finish. After a pair of knives are jammed through his eyes, the blinded Beta welcomes an army of walkers to consume him entirely. Meanwhile, Carol and Lydia lead the walker horde over a cliff, thus ending the Whisperers’ reign of terror once and for all. Breathlessly paced, this standout episode manages to cram a feature film’s worth of action into a mere 42 minutes.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The Calm Before</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_915_jld_1102_00604_rt.jpg><p>Season 9, Episode 15</p><p>“The Walking Dead” has never been afraid to kill off a main character or two, depending on the needs of the story. But even longtime viewers were stunned by just how many important characters had their decapitated heads jammed on pikes by the end of the ninth season’s penultimate episode. Having infiltrated the Kingdom’s community fair, a disguised Alpha wanders the joyous festivities, secretly choosing ten victims worthy of beheading. Among the dearly departed are Enid, Tara, and Carol’s adopted son Henry. Directed with solemn reverence by Laura Belsey, the events of this nightmarish episode will continue to resonate with fans long after the Whisperers are silenced forever.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Killer Within</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_gp_304_0614_0413.jpg><p>Season 3, Episode 4</p><p>The rusty boiler room of a prison overrun with flesh-hungry corpses is a sub-optimal setting for childbirth. When walkers swarm the West Georgia Correctional Facility where Rick and his cohorts are living, the group has no choice but to split up and fend for themselves against the undead. Maggie, Carl, and a very pregnant Lori end up trapped together just as Lori goes into labor. Naturally, complications ensue, and Maggie is forced to perform a lethal Caesarian delivery in order to save the baby’s life. This leaves young Carl with the unenviable task of shooting his dead mom in the head to prevent her body from reanimating. An emotionally shattering episode.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Walk With Us</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8.-Walk-With-Us.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Season 10, Episode 12</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Filled to the brim with consequential scenes and emotional farewells, “Walk with Us” begins with a massive fiery action sequence that resembles something out of “Game of Thrones.” As Hilltop burns to a cinder and our heroes fight a losing battle against a horde of flaming walkers, Judith is rescued by kindhearted Earl, who sadly gets bitten and must be put down by the young warrior herself. As if that wasn’t weighty enough, Beta viciously kills Gamma, and Negan finally springs his trap on Alpha, luring her to a remote cabin and beheading her in cold blood. The episode’s final moment reveals that Carol has been Negan’s puppet-master all along. “Took you long enough,” she quips as Negan presents her with Alpha’s severed noggin.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>“A”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_416_gp_1121_0056.jpg><p>Season 4, Episode 16</p><p>On the road to Terminus, Rick, Carl, and Michonne are ambushed by the brutal Claimers, who threaten to rape and murder Carl and Michonne before Rick’s very eyes. Daryl, who reluctantly joined the Claimers when he became separated from his friends, tries to intercede, but Joe, the leader of the Claimers, decides to kill him, too, just for fun. This terrifying ordeal comes to a blood-drenched end when Rick literally bites through Joe’s jugular vein, killing him instantly while Michonne and Daryl finish off the rest. Things get even worse, however, when Rick and his crew finally arrive at Terminus, only to discover that it’s run by cannibals. Containing several of the most nerve-wracking scenes in “Walking Dead” history, this fourth season finale is a gore-splattered gift to hardcore survival horror fans.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Pretty Much Dead Already</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_207_0901_1723.jpg><p>Season 2, Episode 7</p><p>In hindsight, this heartbreaking mid-season finale is where “The Walking Dead” went from being an exciting zombie show to something much deeper. After learning that the Greene family’s barn is filled with walkers, Rick and Hershel argue about how to handle the bizarre situation. Shane, meanwhile, encourages the rest of the group to wipe out the walkers, regardless of their host’s wishes. This philosophical conflict finally explodes when Shane releases the walkers and begins mowing them down en masse. But the true magnitude of the tragedy is revealed when Carol’s missing 12-year old daughter Sophia stumbles out of the barn as one of the undead, forcing Rick to put her down himself. The repercussions of this agonizing episode continue to haunt the show’s characters many years later.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>No Way Out</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_609_gp_0825_0206-rt.jpg><p>Season 6, Episode 9</p><p>Paced like a runaway rollercoaster, this mid-season premiere opens with a bang (literally!) as Daryl blows a group of Saviors to kingdom come with Abraham’s RPG launcher. Meanwhile, back at Alexandria, Rick leads a small group of survivors through a herd of walkers using the old blood and guts camouflage trick. But 10-year old Sam panics during their escape, causing the walkers to eat him and his mother Jessie alive. In short order, Michonne impales Ron with her katana, Carl gets shot in the eye, Carol threatens to kill Morgan, Glenn and Enid rescue Maggie, Rick goes berserk and leads a hand-to-hand assault on hundreds of walkers, and Daryl uses a fuel truck and another RPG blast to turn Alexandria’s pond into a boiling cauldron. If you want non-stop action, then “No Way Out” is the episode for you.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The Day Will Come When You Won’t Be</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_701_gp_0504_0116-rt.jpg><p>Season 7, Episode 1</p><p>Depicted in unflinching detail, the savage brutality on display in this controversial seventh season premiere actually caused some longtime fans to abandon the show out of sheer disgust. While there’s no question that this is the all-time ugliest hour in “Walking Dead” history, it’s also one of the most riveting. What makes it so hard to watch isn’t the graphic violence that we’re shown (although Glenn’s ruined face is truly difficult to stomach), it’s the unbridled glee that Negan exhibits while smashing his victims’ skulls into pulp that’s impossible to forget. Without this over-the-top level of extreme visceral horror, however, it’s doubtful that Negan would have emerged as the series’ quintessential human villain the way that he needed to. Although not an episode that you’re likely to revisit often, “The Day Will Come When You Won’t Be” remains a darkly disturbing masterpiece of terror.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>No Sanctuary</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_501_gp_0512_0054.jpg><p>Season 5, Episode 1</p><p>If there was ever a doubt that deceptively meek Carol Peletier is indeed the most badass character on “The Walking Dead,” this thrill-packed fifth season premiere is all the proof needed to erase those misgivings. Captured by the Terminus cannibals, Rick and his crew are seconds away from becoming human tartare, but Carol’s fearless assault on the fortified train yard blows the surrounding fences sky high, unleashing a flood of walkers into the compound. Disguising herself as one of the undead, Carol storms Terminus like a pint-size Rambo, blasting cannibals and walkers alike until finally setting her sights on Mary, the witchy matriarch of Terminus, in a no-holds-barred fight to the death. A sterling showcase for series MVP Melissa McBride, “No Sanctuary” is the benchmark by which all other action-oriented “Walking Dead” episodes are judged.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Days Gone Bye</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/101_rt_photospread_blackwomanzombie.jpg><p>Season 1, Episode 1</p><p>Thinking back to the debut episode of “The Walking Dead,” it’s the iconic imagery that springs vividly to mind rather than the simple story it tells. From Rick waking up in a deserted hospital, to the eerie warning “Don’t Open Dead Inside” spray painted on a pair of chained doors, to a little girl walker mindlessly clutching a bloody teddy bear, to the surreal half-walker dragging itself across the grass, to Rick’s solitary journey into Atlanta on horseback, to the first horde of walkers that he encounters, to the abandoned tank that he takes shelter in, “Days Gone Bye” is a visual marvel that brilliantly recreates the first two issues of Robert Kirkman’s influential comic book series. It’s impossible to imagine a better premiere episode than this one.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The Grove</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/twd_414_gp_1016_0067.jpg><p>Season 4, Episode 14</p><p>This devastating hour of television answers a question that few people had ever thought to ask: what would a zombie show written by John Steinbeck look and sound like? A dazzling standalone episode that contains echoes of the 1937 novella “Of Mice and Men,” “The Grove” opens with Carol and Tyreese caring for baby Judith, 10-year old Mika, and 12-year old Lizzie after becoming separated from the group following the Governor’s attack on the prison. What follows is a profoundly moving meditation on guilt, despair, remorse, and redemption. In the challenging role of Lizzie, young actress Brighton Rosie Sharbino delivers an ineffably poignant performance, portraying an innocent child whose sense of right and wrong has been all but obliterated in the apocalypse. As poetic as it is disturbing, “The Grove” is a modern TV classic.</p></li></ul><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap lrv-a-font-primary-s o-nav__title a-content-ignore
