The award-winning singer, who famously sang Edith Piaf’s La Vie en Rose in “A Star in Born,” and performed the song during her Las Vegas residency Jazz and Piano, is rumored to be rehearsing her performance for the Opening Ceremony. R&B star Aya Nakamura and Celine Dion are also rumored to be performing.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For the first time in history, the Opening Ceremony is set to take place outside of a stadium and will be held along the Seine River that runs through the city. The nautical show will be following 85 boats carrying athletes from each Olympic delegation on a four-mile parade. Kicking off from the Pont d’Austerlitz and culminating at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, the ceremony will showcase the city’s historical landmarks and will bring together 3,500 actors, dancers and musical performers.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The show has been designed by theatre director Thomas Jolly, best known for hit rock-opera musical “Starmania”. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-type=link data-id=https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-opening-ceremony-thomas-jolly-165c4ed071be5e65fd854dedef693a0f>In an interview with the Associated Press</a>, Jolly remained tight-lipped about the performers saying, “All I can tell you is that it will be very meaningful for the artists that will perform.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Gaga is headed into a busy few months. Her latest film “Joker: Folie à Deux” sees her playing Harley Quinn in the sequel to 2019’s “Joker” and will be released on Oct. 4. It is said to feature 15 reinterpretations of classic songs, but if, and how many original songs remains a mystery, as does Gaga’s contribution to the film’s music.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She has also been busy recording her seventh studio album.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Speaking recently about the progress on the untitled work, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://variety.com/2024/scene/news/lady-gaga-chromatica-ball-covid-1236014645/>Gaga said</a>, “I have written so many songs and I have produced so many songs.” Gaga added, “It’s nothing like anything that I’ve ever made before.” Gaga hinted she liked to break genre and enjoyed exploring music. She said, “There’s something really beautiful about knowing that you will be loved no matter what you do.”</p><p>From <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety US</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2traKWlqLake8alppuZnGS8rcXMqaCcq12hrqXFjKCYoJldpbKzss6rpGaZpGLBqbGMqKeeppmjtG6vxKucpqeernqxrdGiqmZqYGeBbn2VbGdsZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
