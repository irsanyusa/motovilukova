They’ve been dubbed “FLiRT” variants based on the technical names for their mutations, one of which includes the letters “F” and “L,” and another of which includes the letters “R” and “T.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Within the FLiRT family, one variant in particular has risen to prominence: KP.2, which accounted for about 25% of new sequenced cases during the two weeks ending Apr. 27, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to data</a> from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Other FLiRT variants, including KP.1.1, have not become as widespread in the U.S. yet.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Researchers are still learning about the FLiRT variants, and many questions remain about how quickly they’ll spread, whether they’ll cause disease that’s more or less severe than what we’ve seen previously, and how well vaccines will stand up to them. Here’s what we know so far.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Is another COVID-19 wave coming?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite KP.2's rise in the U.S., it’s too soon to tell whether the FLiRT family will be responsible for a major surge in cases, says Dr. Eric Topol, executive vice president at Scripps Research, who wrote about the FLiRT variants in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent edition of his newsletter</a>. For now, the amount of SARS-CoV-2 virus in U.S. wastewater remains “minimal,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the CDC</a>, and hospitalizations and deaths have also continued to decline steadily since their recent peaks in January. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">At the global level</a>, case counts rose from early to mid-April, but remain far lower than they were a few months ago.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">KP.2 and its relatives will likely cause an uptick in cases, but “my hunch is it won’t be a big wave,” Topol says. “It might be a ‘wavelet.’” That’s because people who were recently infected by the JN.1 variant seem to have some protection against reinfection, Topol says, and the virus hasn’t mutated enough to become wildly different from previous strains. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A recent study</a> from researchers in Japan, which was posted online before being peer-reviewed, also found that KP.2 is less infectious than JN.1.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Do vaccines protect against KP.2 and other FLiRT variants?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Vaccines still provide good protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. But two preliminary studies—the one from Japan and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another from researchers in China</a>, which was also posted online before being peer-reviewed—suggest the FLiRT variants may be better at dodging immune protection from vaccines than JN.1 was.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“That isn’t good,” Topol says, especially since many people who got the most recent booster—roughly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">30% of adults in the U.S.</a>— got it last fall, meaning their protection has begun to wane.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an Apr. 26 statement</a>, the World Health Organization recommended basing future vaccine formulations on the JN.1 lineage, since it seems the virus will continue to evolve from that variant. The most recent booster was based on an older strain, XBB.1.5.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How can I stay safe from new COVID-19 variants?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The virus continues to evolve, but public-health advice remains the same: stay up-to-date on vaccines, test before gatherings, stay home when you're ill, and consider masking and avoiding crowded indoor areas, especially when lots of COVID-19 is going around.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWdnfnV%2Fjpymr6GUYn56ecWloKusXauus7XAp6usZZulenN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
