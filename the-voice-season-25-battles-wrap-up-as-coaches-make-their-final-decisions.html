A steal allows a coach to take a losing artist from another team in the Battles, while a playoff pass allows them to keep an artist on their team and send them straight to the Playoffs.</p><p>During Monday’s show, Madison Curbelo and Kyle Schuesler went head to head on Team Dan + Shay, singing “Lucky” by Jason Mraz. Notably, they both sang much of the song in Spanish. The coaches gave them a standing ovation for the performance.</p><p>Dan + Shay chose Kyle as the winner of the Battle. John Legend ended up hitting his steal button for Madison, but the coaching duo chose to use their playoff pass to send her straight to the live shows, blocking Legend from stealing her.</p><p>Later in the episode, the duo used their steal to bring Olivia Rubini to their team after she performed against Jackie Romeo in a Battle on Team Legend to “Edge of Seventeen” by Stevie Nicks. Both singers are going to the Knockouts.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHAT ARE ‘THE VOICE’ COACHES’ SALARIES FOR SEASON 25?</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-john-legend-finally-uses-his-steal-on-val-t-webb>John Legend Finally Uses His Steal on Val T. Webb</h3><p>The final Battle of the season took place during Tuesday night’s show, featuring Val T. Webb and RLETTO on Team Chance. They performed “Saving All My Love for You” by Whitney Houston. The coaches were wowed, with Dan Smyers calling it “one of the most iconic performances I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Chance ended up choosing RLETTO as the winner of the Battle, but Val isn’t leaving the competition just yet. Legend hit his steal button to take Val for his team. Both singers will be going to the Knockouts, which start next week.</p><p>What did you think of this week’s Battles?
