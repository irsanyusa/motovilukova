No passion: </strong>Women are more emotional than men, and will adore a man who isn't bland. He only needs to show how much he loves her, not just saying it.</p><p><strong>2. Doesn't show maturity:</strong> No woman really likes a man who still makes childish decisions, especially when it comes to serious issues. Not being able to take certain responsibilities is a big turn off for any woman.</p><p><strong>3. Keeping secrets: </strong>When a woman can't trust a man, that's because there's openness between them. She bound to become uncomfortable and walk away from the secrets.</p><p><strong>4. Hardly pays attention: </strong>Women love it when the men they love listens to them. Relationships are bound to break if a man doesn't pay enough attention to his woman and is always caught up in his own world.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>5. Never says the truth: </strong>As much as you want to keep things to yourself, no woman</p><p><strong>6. He's very selfish:</strong> Love isn't selfish. A selfish relationship will never see the light of day. Women enjoy a relationship where her happiness is always on her man's mind.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR70qKloKSVYq6vsIymmKuqmZqxboOMq5yaq5%2BjwG7Dzqacp2Wcmq63sYygpqicXaKyr3uSr2ykb2Ju</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
