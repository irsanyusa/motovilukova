So&nbsp;today, we’ll go&nbsp;over the touching eulogy Angelina Jolie wrote for her mother to&nbsp;always hold her memory close to&nbsp;her heart.</p><p><h2>Marcheline made it&nbsp;her life’s work to&nbsp;raise her kids.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b66/a31/f6c651509c81b413d4aff7455b.jpg><p>Anthony Taafe/Coleman-Rayner/EAST NEWS<span>, </span>Anthony Taafe/Coleman-Rayner/EAST NEWS</p><p>Just like her daughter, Marcheline Bertrand had pursued a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;acting and appeared in&nbsp;small movie productions. However, she put everything on&nbsp;hold when she married Jon Voight, and they both made the decision to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. Sadly, they had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>miscarriage</a>, from which Bertrand greatly suffered.</p><p>Marcheline and Jon had their first child, James, in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1973</a>, and Angelina was born in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1975</a>. However, the marriage did not last long, and because of&nbsp;Jon’s adultery, they <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a> a&nbsp;few years later, with Bertrand taking full responsibility for her children, and him, only financially supporting his family.</p><p><h2>Angelina’s relationship with her father was complicated.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/574/bdd/611f54500684bc5d44403bf7b1.jpg><p>CPA/LFI/EAST NEWS</p><p>Although Jon Voight provided for his ex-wife and their 2&nbsp;children financially, Jolie never had a&nbsp;strong bond with her father, blaming him for their separation. “I&nbsp;didn’t feel that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>close</a> to&nbsp;my&nbsp;father. I&nbsp;felt more like my&nbsp;mother’s daughter when&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;child.”</p><p>Angelina had always been candid about their tumultuous relationship and how she had grown apart from him. She even chose not to&nbsp;use her father’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surname</a> to&nbsp;distance herself from him and his fame. Nonetheless, Angelina pursued a&nbsp;professional acting career and eventually surpassed the fame of&nbsp;her Oscar-winning father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e4/f8e/36c19b58fd85c2182e60a35282.jpg><p>LFI/Avalon.red/REPORTER / East News</p><p>Angelina and Jon have, however, recently attempted to&nbsp;work past their differences and come together for the benefit of&nbsp;their family. Even during the difficult period of&nbsp;her divorce from Brad Pitt, Angelina’s father has been a&nbsp;strong backer. “He’s been very good at&nbsp;understanding they needed their grandfather at&nbsp;this time,” the actress firmly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>.</p><p><h2>She has always looked to&nbsp;her mother for guidance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/362/e8f/3eade05b0389ea9c6cc3ca59cc.jpg><p>Anthony Taafe/Coleman-Rayner/EAST NEWS</p><p>Angelina has consistently portrayed her mother as&nbsp;someone who sacrificed everything to&nbsp;protect her children. “When my&nbsp;father had an&nbsp;affair, it&nbsp;changed her life,” Angelina <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>. “It&nbsp;set her dream of&nbsp;family life ablaze. But she still loved being a&nbsp;mother. ”</p><p>Angelina’s daughter, who is&nbsp;constantly on&nbsp;the front lines of&nbsp;assisting those in&nbsp;need, has undoubtedly inherited her humanitarian tendencies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/59b/225/88ce505b90940751be91dd60ce.jpg><p>Anthony Taafe/Coleman-Rayner/EAST NEWS</p><p>Angelina learned a&nbsp;lot about parenting from Marcheline. Jolie discussed the experiences of&nbsp;her mother and how having children of&nbsp;her own has allowed her to&nbsp;rediscover her spirit and maternal instinct. The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>, “She enjoyed&nbsp;me, and&nbsp;I feel I’m enjoying my&nbsp;kids. If&nbsp;anybody ever tells me&nbsp;that I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;mother to&nbsp;them like my&nbsp;mom was to&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great compliment.”</p><p>Since her divorce from Brad Pitt, Angelina hopes to&nbsp;be&nbsp;like her mother and develop the same courage she had as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother. “I&nbsp;will never be&nbsp;as&nbsp;good a&nbsp;mother as&nbsp;she was. I&nbsp;will try my&nbsp;best, but&nbsp;I don’t think&nbsp;I ever will&nbsp;be. She was the most generous, loving woman. She’s better than&nbsp;me,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a> the actress.</p><p><h2>The disease and the heart-breaking loss of&nbsp;her mother</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/08a/994/5d80fc5c2f9976e544683ced86.jpg><p>Anthony Taafe/Coleman-Rayner/EAST NEWS</p><p>“My&nbsp;mother seemed peaceful when she first knew she had <a href=# title=cancer data-link=tag>cancer</a>,” Angelina <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spoke out</a> about her mother’s illness. Marcheline Bertrand was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in&nbsp;the late 1990s and battled it&nbsp;for over a&nbsp;decade. Angelina’s mother has also founded an&nbsp;ovarian cancer support organization over the years. After a&nbsp;long illness, she died on&nbsp;January&nbsp;27, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2007</a>.</p><p>Her grief over Marcheline’s absence and the void it&nbsp;left completely changed Angelina’s approach to&nbsp;life. “I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lost my&nbsp;mother</a> in&nbsp;my&nbsp;thirties. When I&nbsp;look back to&nbsp;that time, I&nbsp;can see how much her death changed&nbsp;me.” She went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>say</a>, “I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;get emotional. I&nbsp;wish she were here. I&nbsp;am never going to&nbsp;stop missing her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bf4/b6b/253f115bfbbb9ad392e73f3c05.jpg><p>Jolie had to&nbsp;take extreme safety measures because she had also lost her grandmother and aunt to&nbsp;breast cancer. “As&nbsp;I&nbsp;stood in&nbsp;the hospital’s hallway, her doctor told me&nbsp;she had promised my&nbsp;mother that she would make sure&nbsp;I was informed about my&nbsp;medical options,” Angelina <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>.</p><p>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;lower her chances of&nbsp;developing breast cancer, Angelina disclosed in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2013</a> that she had undergone a&nbsp;preventative double mastectomy.&nbsp;2&nbsp;years later, the award winner decided to&nbsp;have her uterine tubes and ovaries removed.</p><p><h2>Angelina wrote a&nbsp;touching message in&nbsp;honor of&nbsp;their bond.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/816/464/42519d51e69327802c6266fe5d.jpg><p>The well-known actress cherishes her mother’s memory and has published a&nbsp;lengthy, heartfelt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>eulogy</a> that pays tribute to&nbsp;the wonderful person Marcheline was and encourages those who are grieving to&nbsp;keep going. Living without a&nbsp;mother can be&nbsp;difficult, and Angelina had faced many difficulties in&nbsp;accepting it&nbsp;and moving&nbsp;on.</p><p>“I’ve had my&nbsp;own <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>loss</a> and seen my&nbsp;life take a&nbsp;different direction. And it&nbsp;hurt more than&nbsp;I imagined it&nbsp;ever would.” She described their lovely relationship, referring to&nbsp;her mother as&nbsp;her best friend. “There are no&nbsp;words to&nbsp;express what an&nbsp;amazing woman and mother she was,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jolie wrote</a>. “She was our best friend.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d23/2d1/baeeb85390af1e7b45c43e6e8c.jpg><p>Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have 6&nbsp;children: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne. While she is&nbsp;still struggling to&nbsp;accept her mother’s death, she is&nbsp;grateful that her mother could see some of&nbsp;her grandchildren while fighting cancer. “My&nbsp;mom was born to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grandmother</a>; she would have just loved&nbsp;it. She did meet some of&nbsp;my&nbsp;children, and she was fantastic.”</p><p>Despite her best efforts to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the best mother to&nbsp;her children, the actress would “give anything for her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with me&nbsp;at&nbsp;this time.” Considering her mother a&nbsp;role model, Angelina is&nbsp;now well aware of&nbsp;the values she wants to&nbsp;pass on&nbsp;to&nbsp;her kids to&nbsp;raise them with the same love and affection she had received from her mother. “She gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;great <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sense of&nbsp;love</a>. I&nbsp;might have been nutty in&nbsp;my&nbsp;youth, but&nbsp;I was always loving.”</p><p>What kind of&nbsp;bond do&nbsp;you have with your mother? Do&nbsp;you look up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;role model?</p><p>Angelina Jolie, often in&nbsp;the limelight for her beauty, finds herself juxtaposed with <a href=#>legendary actress Claudia Cardinale</a>, whose image was controversially altered for the 2017 Cannes Film Festival poster. The debate revolved around modern beauty standards, with Cardinale herself dismissing concerns, emphasizing the dreamlike nature of&nbsp;the edit.</p><p>Delving into Jolie’s personal life, her tumultuous relationship with her father, Oscar-winning actor John Voight, has been a&nbsp;topic of&nbsp;much discussion. Their bond, strained by&nbsp;past disagreements and Voight’s admitted infidelity, saw them estranged for years. However, the passing of&nbsp;Jolie’s mother became a&nbsp;turning point, leading to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>slow reconciliation</a>. Their shared love for cinema and the presence of&nbsp;Jolie’s children, especially during her divorce from Brad Pitt, played pivotal roles in&nbsp;mending their bond.</p><p>On&nbsp;the front of&nbsp;motherhood, Angelina Jolie’s journey began unexpectedly in&nbsp;Cambodia. Initially not keen on&nbsp;motherhood, her perspective shifted dramatically after a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;the Southeast Asian nation. While filming “Tomb Raider,” she connected deeply with the country, leading her to&nbsp;adopt baby Maddox from a&nbsp;Cambodian orphanage. Their <a href=#>instant bond</a> was evident, with Maddox smiling at&nbsp;Jolie amidst a&nbsp;sea of&nbsp;crying babies. Despite adoption challenges due to&nbsp;baby trafficking concerns, Jolie’s determination prevailed. Maddox’s Cambodian heritage remains integral to&nbsp;his identity, with Jolie ensuring he&nbsp;stays connected to&nbsp;his roots, evident in&nbsp;their collaborative film project “First They Killed My&nbsp;Father” and the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation’s work in&nbsp;Cambodia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK6vs8SloKeZXZ%2B8rbXEZqeasaNiwbO1wa6rnmWkpHqpsdFmo5qslWK6sMDHnqlmmZ6ZerOx1Z6YpatdqbWmtdFmm56doKHGbq%2FLqKqeZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXp5fJdqbmpn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
