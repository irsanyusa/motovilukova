In the late 1960s, he formed what became known as the Manson Family, a quasi-commune based in California. Manson's followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations over a period of five weeks in the summer of 1969. The crimes captivated the public due to their gruesome nature and the seemingly random and senseless violence they entailed.</p><p>Manson was not physically present at the scenes of the murders, but was nonetheless convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder due to the control and influence he exerted over his followers. Among the most infamous crimes was the murder of actress <a href=#>Sharon Tate</a> and four others at her home. Manson convinced his followers that these murders would help ignite an apocalyptic race war, which he termed "Helter Skelter," after the Beatles song of the same name.</p><p>In 1971, Manson was convicted and initially sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life with the possibility of parole after California invalidated the state's death penalty statute in 1972. Manson served out his life sentence at California State Prison, Corcoran and died in 2017.</p><p>Despite his heinous crimes, Manson has remained a figure of public fascination, in large part due to his manipulative personality and his ability to exert control over his followers. His case has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries, and filmsâ€”including most recently serving as an inspiration in the <a href=#>Quentin Tarantino</a> film <a href=#>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a> (2019).</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>November 12</a>, <a href=#>1934</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Cincinnati, Ohio, USA</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Silent Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Dog</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Scorpio</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>November 19</a>, <a href=#>2017</a> (aged 83)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Natural causes</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1970-03-01</a> Charles Manson's album "Lie" is released</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1971-01-19</a> The Beatles' "Helter Skelter" is played at Charles Manson trial</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1971-01-25</a> Charles Manson and three female followers are convicted of the Tate-LaBianca murders</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1971-04-19</a> Charles Manson sentenced to life in prison for the murder of <a href=#>Sharon Tate</a></li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1976-04-01</a> "Helter Skelter", detailing Charles Manson's cult "family", their capture, trial, conviction and aftermath, premieres on CBS</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1981-06-13</a> <a href=#>Tom Snyder</a> interviews murderer Charles Manson on "Tomorrow"</li></ul><h2>Personal Life</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1955-01-17</a> American murderer Charles Manson (20) weds American waitress Rosalie Jean Willis (17); divorce in 1958</li></ul><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Serial Killers</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwr8eaqaWdo2K6orrSqKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
