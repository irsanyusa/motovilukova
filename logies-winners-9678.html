The long-running soap opera now&nbsp;has a record nine Logies for Most Popular Drama Series, Miniseries or Telemovie.</p><p>In the first individual award, “Heartbreak High’s” Thomas Weatherall won the TV Week Silver Logie for Most Outstanding Supporting Actor.</p><p>“Have You Been Paying Attention?” takes out its fourth Logie for Most Popular Comedy Program.</p><p>“Crazy Fun Park” from the ABC won Most Outstanding Children’s Program, surprising many who had assumed the worldwide-popular “Bluey” would take home the award. The creators’ acknowledged the surprise, starting their speech with&nbsp;“I’m really sorry everyone.”</p><p>Amy Shark, musician, judge on “Australian Idol” and <a href=# rel=noopener>former Rolling Stone AU/NZ&nbsp;cover star</a>, performed and then took home the Graham Kennedy Award for Most Popular New Talent.</p><p>And last year’s Graham Kennedy Award winner, the ABC’s Tony Armstrong, then backed up his award with the Bert Newton Award for Most Popular Presenter.</p><p>Harriet Dyer, co-creator and star of “Colin From Accounts” then received the second award for the Binge program, winning the Silver Logie for Most Outstanding Actress, while her partner and co-star Patrick Brammall later took out Most Outstanding Actor, bringing the show’s total award haul to three.</p><p>“Travel Guides” then won Most Popular Lifestyle Program for the second year running.</p><p>Later on in the evening, <a href=#>TV production legend Brian Walsh</a> was posthumously inducted into the Hall of Fame. Local and international stars including Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman paid tribute to his foresight, legacy and kindness.</p><p>From there, “Australian Survivor: Heroes v Villains” won Most Outstanding Reality Program, while Most Popular Reality Program went to “MasterChef Australia” for its Fans and Favourites season. The win was dedicated to the <a href=#>late Jock Zonfrillo</a>, who hosted the program alongside Melissa Leong and Andy Allen.</p><p>“The Cheap Seats” won its first Logie for Most Outstanding Entertainment Program up against some heavy competition. Last year, co-host <a href=#>Melanie Bracewell told&nbsp;Variety Australia</a> that unlike some other comedians, there was no sense of irony in her excitement about “TV’s night of nights”.</p><p>“The great thing about the show is that we kind of had low expectations for ourselves. The network had low expectations. We were just filling a slot that was usually “NCIS” repeats. So there was a really low bar to sort of clamber over,” she said of making the show.</p><p>“So every time we get another season, or we do an episode that we’re proud of, we are stoked.”</p><p>Towards the end of the evening, Most Popular Actor went to veteran Sam Neill for his work on Foxtel’s “The Twelve”. It was Neill’s second ever Logie, after he won Most Outstanding Actor in a Series in 2005 for “Jessica”. Brooke Satchwell also took out Best Supporting Actress for “The Twelve”.</p><p>With “The Twelve” also taking out Most Outstanding Drama, Miniseries or Telemovie, it equalled the record for the night of three Logies, an honour it shared with “Colin From Accounts”.</p><h2>All the winners at the 2023 Logie Awards</h2><p><strong>TV WEEK GOLD LOGIE for Most Popular Personality on Australian
