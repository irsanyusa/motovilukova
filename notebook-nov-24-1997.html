Even the most modern flyby satellites can’t compete with this old aerial war-horse, which can skirt space 13 or more miles above the earth, peer at bad guys for eight hours or longer, plus take the most detailed photos. A U-2 primer:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ORIGIN: Developed at the CIA’s behest during the cold war to spy on the Soviet Union, the plane was created by Lockheed’s famed Skunk Works unit (nicknamed after the “Skonk Works” in Al Capp’s comic strip, Li’l Abner).The aircraft made its first flight in August 1955.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">MISSION: High-altitude voyeurism. The reconnaissance plane collects multisensor photo, electro-optic, infrared and radar imagery–day or night and in all kinds of weather. It’s been used to peek at everyone from Khrushchev to Castro to Ho Chi Minh, left. Among its more benign photo ops: floods, volcanoes and crops.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">LATEST VERSION: The current aircraft is 40% larger than the original U-2. The single-seat, single-engine, glider-like plane has a length of 63 ft. and a wingspan of 103 ft. Each plane costs an estimated $34 million, and 36 are on active duty.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">NOMENCLATURE: The government originally said it was a weather-reconnaissance aircraft and labeled the plane U for utility. U.S. pilots call it the Dragon Lady. The Soviets dubbed the planes the black ladies of espionage. (No, the band, bottom, didn’t take its name from the plane; band members just liked the sound of it.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES: Limited. There are only about 60 U-2 pilots, and just 39% of applicants get the job. Home base: Beale A.F.B. in California.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">WORKING ENVIRONMENT: Near outer space. The U-2 can fly above 70,000 feet. Its cruising speed is a relatively slow 430 m.p.h., which can make it vulnerable (seven have been shot down), and its range is more than 4,000 miles. Dress code for pilots: a full-pressure astronaut-like suit when flying. They breathe 100% oxygen and wear UCDs–urinary-collection devices–for obvious reasons.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">WEAK POINT: Rube Goldberg-like take-offs and landings, utilizing a flimsy bicycle landing-gear arrangement. Pogo outriggers support the wings and drop away when the plane lifts off. On landing, “it’s like riding a bike off the back end of a flatbed truck at 70 m.p.h.,” says U-2 pilot Major Jeff Jungemann. As the plane descends, another pilot races behind it in a Chevy Camaro, radioing to the plane’s pilot his distance to the runway.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">MOST FAMOUS MOMENT: May Day 1960, below, when Francis Gary Powers’ U-2 was shot down by the Soviet Union. The incident ignited a cold war crisis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">MOST IMPORTANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS: Classified.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HEALTH REPORT</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">THE GOOD NEWS</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HALCION DAYS A new independent study says the sleeping pill Halcion is safe and effective when used as recommended.
