That included Chris and Syd, a country singer who performs with his dog. Check out their audition below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WICOYPLpmmw</p>Chris and Syd audition for “America’s Got Talent.”</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Simon Cowell’s Dog Squiddly Judges An ‘AGT’ Act</h2><p>Chris performed his audition from his truck in Cedar City, Utah.

Your dog actually was singing along with you,” Simon Cowell said. “And Sqiddly was tapping her head as it went along. So we both actually loved it.” Chris received four “yes” votes from the judges to move forward.
