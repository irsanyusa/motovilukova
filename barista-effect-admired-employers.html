They could check “yes” or leave the response blank. Full methodology is available <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Related:&nbsp;What It Takes To Be One of the Most Admired Employers</a></p><p><a href=#>Starbucks’ </a>ranking is likely low because people see employment there as a temporary stopover rather than something they’d consider long-term, said Jack Russo, an Edward Jones analyst who follows <a href=#>Starbucks</a>. The fast food industry is known for its high turnover rate, despite <a href=#>Starbucks</a> employee benefits such as education compensation, he added. Factoring in the current low unemployment rate, some people are in a position to be more selective with jobs, Russo said.</p><p><a href=#>Related:&nbsp;Millennials Want to Work for ‘Socially Acceptable’ Tech Companies</a></p><p>The&nbsp;general public’s aversion to a job at a place like <a href=#>Starbucks</a> could also be linked to the stigma people associate with a part-time food service job, he said.</p><p>Jabez LeBret, co-founder and chief marketing officer at the legal marketing firm GNGF, said respondents’ politics could also contribute to views toward companies such as <a href=#>Starbucks</a> and <a href=#>Uber</a>, given their activities on social and political issues.</p><p>In February, a Morning Consult poll showed people were split over how they felt about <a href=#>Starbucks’</a> response to the White House’s proposed travel ban by announcing its intention to hire 10,000 refugees over five years. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forty-seven percent</a> of people supported the hiring and 38 percent were against it. The difference was more pronounced when factoring in political parties: Sixty-two percent of Democratic respondents said they liked <a href=#>Starbucks </a>more knowing that the company took a stand, compared with 53 percent of Republicans who said they had a greater distaste for the coffee chain.</p><p>LeBret said one issue that affects <a href=#>Starbucks</a> also affects other big consumer companies: the lack of ownership of how its brand comes across. Instead, consumers are in control because they have access to consumers’ and employees’ social media streams as well as websites such as Yelp that offer crowd-sourced perspectives of a brand based on personal experiences.</p><p><a href=#>Related:&nbsp;The Political Divide Exists for Employers</a></p><p>People&nbsp;view <a href=#>Starbucks</a> more favorably when asked to evaluate their overall perception of the company, rather than its allure as a potential employer. Sixty-three percent of people have a favorable view of <a href=#>Starbucks</a>, according to Morning Consult Brand Intelligence. In comparison, 80 percent of people say they have a positive view of Walgreens.</p><p>“We have really pushed people to think that higher education is only the answer,” LeBret said. “I&nbsp;don’t think that’s helped our perception of good jobs.”</p><p>But LeBret painted a slightly different picture for <a href=#>Uber</a>, which he noted has been hit with bad press recently.</p><p>“<span>I don’t think <a href=#>Uber’s</a> ever had control of it’s message,” he said. “It’s so young. People are going to plug into your brand any way they see fit.”</span></p><p><a href=#>Uber </a>also struggles to maintain broad support from Americans overall — 47 percent of poll respondents say they have a positive view of the company, according to Morning Consult Brand Intelligence.&nbsp;That compares with a 73 percent average for tech companies included in Morning Consult surveys.</p><p>Representatives from <a href=#>Starbucks</a> and <a href=#>Uber</a> did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hhbHxxgo5qaWiakae2tMDAZpyfnpWYwW6tw6agq52UYrKuvMuosJ6qo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
