We now have a first look of <a href=#>The Masked Singer </a>Season 7 costumes and a hint at the show’s new format. Since filming of the seventh season began, the network has been quick to share many things about the upcoming season, which begins on March 9 at 8 p.m. ET on FOX with the beloved judges all returning.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Masked Singer Premieres New Costume Style, Group Formatting</h2><p>FOX revealed the first look at some costumes for The Masked Singer‘s upcoming season. They aired the first look during their broadcast of the NFL’s NFC Championship game. The promotional video shared the costumes of six of the upcoming masked celebrities.</p><p>The advertisement shared that this season would change up the grouping names. Instead of seeing Group A, Group B, and Wildcards, this season features The Good, The Bad, and The Cuddly. Definitely a different approach to teams, but I’m kind of here for the new format.</p><p>The preview shows some of the newest costumes for this season. Within the preview fans can see multiple new costumes, like a frog prince, a blowfish, another monster, a possum, and more. The preview showed off two costumes from each group, but did not share their official names. Fans should expect the series to roll out more costumes and names as the season gets closer.</p><p>From this preview, I have a sneaking suspicion that The Masked Singer will be changing a large amount of their format due to the new teams. With three official teams I think it’ll be interesting to see how the series reformats. Considering they gave all three official group names I wouldn’t expect one of the groups to act as a wildcard.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-do-the-costumes-look-so-different-this-season>Why Do The Costumes Look So Different This Season?</h2><p>In the recent preview fans immediately noticed that this seasons costumes look different than in previous seasons. Although fans shared that they are excited for the upcoming season, they were quick to express their disappointment in the costume design.</p><p>“Well they don’t have the crispness as the others,” a fan commented on Instagram.</p><p>This change in costuming could be due to The Masked Singer‘s costume designer, Marina Toybina departing from the series. On January 14, the costume designer posted on Instagram about her departure.</p><p>“It’s been an incredible journey with my TMS family. We created some extraordinary costumes and unforgettable memories,” Toybina wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “Season 6 was my last season as the costume designer and I hope you all enjoyed our TV magic. I’m excited for what the future holds & wishing my entire team and crew an amazing season 7!”</p><p>Toybina has been designing costumes for the FOX series since season one, so many fans are sad to see her departure from the show. It’s evident now that the new designer of the series has a very different approach to the celebrity costumes.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NUP_194091_0260-1-1.jpeg alt="Derek Hough Guest Hosts ‘The Kelly Clarkson Show,’ Shows Off Topical Dances" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Masked Singer season 7</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWRqLimsIysoKeflad6s7HVnpilq12osqK%2FzqdkcGWTpMC1wcyeqmasmJp6qLvOnWStoJVir6KwjK2fnmWTqrGluNho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
