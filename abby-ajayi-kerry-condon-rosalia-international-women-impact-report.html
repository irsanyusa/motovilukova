Based in Lagos, she has her finger on the pulse of Africa’s pop music mecca. “Everybody can feel the energy. It’s like now is the time,” she says. While “not actively trying to change’’ the male-dominated biz all by herself, Adesanya takes inspiration from the many women “keeping their head down and doing the work. I just know that I’m taking the power that belongs to me.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Abby Ajayi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Abby-Ajayi-2022-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Creator, EP and writer, “Riches”<br>U.K.</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ajayi got her start as a Fulbright scholar studying screenwriting in New York, and she quickly became a powerhouse in the industry. While Ajayi learned from all the shows she’s written for and produced — including “Riches,” “Inventing Anna” and “The First Lady” — she says “Riches” holds a special place in her heart. She wrote, executive produced and directed it. “It was my first greenlight as a creator. To take an original idea from initial seed to a global launch has been an incredible learning experience.” Now Ajayi is in development to adapt one of her own short stories into a TV series.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The Women of “Alice in Borderland”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Alice-of-Borderland-2.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Aya Asahina, Ayaka Miyoshi, Riisa Naka, Tao Tsuchiya, Yuri Tsunematsu<br>Actors<br>Japan</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Netflix’s “Alice in Borderland,” which launched its second season last December, snagged the top spot on the Global Non-English TV list with 61.2 million viewing hours over its premiere weekend. “Great stories, no matter the language or cultural background, can reach people everywhere. I consider myself lucky to be a part of something where success isn’t just defined by budget, but rather by how many people it has reached,” says Tsuchiya, who plays Yuzuha Usagi in the series. Throughout “Alice in Borderland,” a group of enigmatic female characters bring vital life to the narrative, which revolves around a dedicated gamer named Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) who suddenly finds himself in a hollowed-out version of Tokyo, fighting to stay alive with his friends through a series of games. Comparisons to “Squid Game” are inevitable, but the show feels more like a product of the pandemic. “It was unthinkable there’d ever be an empty Shibuya, but once COVID came around, it turned into a reality,” Tsuchiya says.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Rebecca Allen and Jo Charrington</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Rebecca-Allen-Jo-Charrington.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Co-Presidents, EMI Records<br>U.K.</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Last year, two of the U.K.’s most successful female music executives united to run the country’s most storied record label. The move paid off, with EMI regaining its status as Britain’s market share No.1 in 2022, following hits by everyone from Sam Smith and Kim Petras to Elton John and Britney Spears. Allen hails the “new energy” created when Charrington moved across from Capitol U.K., while her co-president relishes being “part of a team where you can not only support each other, but challenge each other.” Their next mission? Global recognition for the U.K. music industry. “As a business, we have constantly delivered and punched above our weight,” Allen says.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jomana R.

In recent months, she’s partnered SRMG with Warner Bros. Discovery and Bloomberg to create the streaming platforms Asharq Discovery and Asharq Quicktake. “We couldn’t go to restaurants five years ago without being split up into two different sections and, but I no longer feel like I’m the woman in the room. I simply feel like we’re all there together, trying to achieve one ambition.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Zeinab Abu Alsamh</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Zeinab-Abu-Alsamh-General-Manager-MBC-STUDIOS-KSA.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>General Manager, MBC Studios Saudi Arabia<br>Saudi Arabia</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A one-time advertising exec who spearheaded campaigns for everything from deodorant to pizza, Alsamh has been doing her part to transform Saudi Arabia into an international production hub since taking charge of MBC Studios in March 2020, greenlighting the English-language features “Desert Warrior,” starring Anthony Mackie; and “Kandahar,” starring Gerard Butler; as well as homegrown content, including the big-budget fantasy-adventure series “Rise of the Witches.” Alsamh notes, “Saudi Arabia has 13 provinces with different accents and traditions. When I say let’s have a diverse slate, it’s not us being politically correct as much as we are very hungry to see our own country in its different colors.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Anitta</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ANITTA2420-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Singer<br>Brazil</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Anitta is a two-time record holder in the Guinness World Records. One for the first solo Latin artist (and first Brazilian artist) to reach No. 1 on Spotify with her song “Envolver” and one for the first Brazilian to win a VMA for a solo project — an award she also received at the EMAs and AMAs. Her critically acclaimed album, “Versions of Me,” was released in three languages: English, Spanish and Portuguese, followed by a memorable performance at Coachella last year. The deluxe edition of the album features new songs with collaborators Missy Elliott, Maluma, A$AP Ferg, Nicky Jam, HARV, L7NNON, Maffio, MC Pedrinho, Pedro Sampaio and Dadju.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The Women of Banijay</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Women-of-Banijay.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Pilar Blasco, CEO of Banijay Iberia<br>Spain<br></strong><br><strong>Cathy Payne, CEO of Banijay Rights<br>U.K.</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Blasco leads a group of some of the most significant indie production companies in Spain and Portugal. Banijay Iberia is involved in new international IP such as “Your Face Sounds Familiar” and “The Bridge.” They’re also behind heavy-weight entertainment brands such as “MasterChef,” “Temptation Island” and “Big Brother.” “People who want to join our industry should be open minded and team oriented because that defines our success,” says Blasco. Payne has overseen dramatic growth of the Banijay Rights’ catalog, which now encompasses more than 152,000 hours and continues to expand. In 2022, Payne’s team was behind major deals for many titles including “Marie Antoinette,” “Rogue Heroes,” “Survivor” and “Big Brother.” Her group also pushed into the premium factual documentary arena. “After the pandemic, we all want television that we can watch en masse and then talk about together,” says Payne of current trends.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Emma Banks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Emma-Banks-Headshot-5.15.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Co-Head of Intl.

Having looked up to trailblazers in the field including Barbara Skydell, Marsha Vlasic and Michele Anthony, Banks tells young women who want to join the field: “Life is a series of compromises and sometimes you need to figure out what is really important to you and make that your priority. Ultimately though, put your heart and soul into what you are doing – half-hearted won’t get the job done, so be the very best you can.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Yulia Evina Bhara</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Yulia-Evina-Bhara-EB_profil2022_01.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>CEO, KawanKawan Media<br>Indonesia</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In Bahasa Indonesia, Kawan means friend or companion, and Bhara revels in the opportunity to collaborate with filmmakers from around the world on movies such as Makbul Mubarak’s “Autobiography,” a Venice prize winner. The challenge: Mastering all parts of the process from start to finish. “Being a producer in Southeast Asia means that you have to do all the work by yourself, from development, financing, and producing to distribution,” she says. “The last step, distribution, is the most challenging phase for me.” Unlike producing theater, where “your job is done when the curtains are closed,” in film, “your job has only started when the film is already made.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Alia Bhatt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Alia-Bhatt-IMG_1026-1-Recovered.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Actor, “RRR” and “Gangubai Kathiawadi”<br>India</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">2022 started off big for Bhatt with a Berlin premiere for her “Gangubhai Kathiawadi” and included the smash hit “RRR,” as well as “Brahmāstra: Part One — Shiva,” in which she co-stars with husband Ranbir Kapoor. “There’s always that one film that’ll transcend language and leave its mark in people’s hearts,” she says. The pair also welcomed a daughter, Raha. She acted with Gal Gadot in Netflix’s “Heart of Stone.” Upcoming she reunites with director Karan Johar and stars opposite Ranveer Singh in “Rocky aur Rani ki Prem Kahani,” out in July. “I am so excited about this one because it’s giving quintessential Bollywood and I’m finally wearing sarees in the snow [so it’s a dream come true from every angle].”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Ximena Cantuarias</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ximena-Cantuarias-Photo-courtesy-of-Telemundo.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>SVP of Scripted Production, Telemundo Global Studios”<br>Mexico</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cantuarias’ 25-plus years in the biz informs her oversight of Telemundo’s shows, including “El Señor de los Cielos” and the International Emmy-winning “Buscando a Frida.” Born in Peru, she helped facilitate the shoot of some key Machu Picchu-set scenes for Telemundo’s “La Reina del Sur.” “Streaming has shaken the foundations of linear television and has forced us to rethink content,” she says. “That’s when proven franchises and good stories play a key role.” She sees “a return to melodrama, love, and heartbreak, which are inexhaustible sources of stories, the way of telling them is simply changing.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Lorna Clarke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Lorna-Clarke-bbc-057-002-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Controller of Pop, BBC<br>U.K.</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Since taking charge of the BBC’s music output — an empire stretching from classical station Radio 3 to TV coverage of Glastonbury Festival — Clarke has faced multiple challenges and risen to them all. Having emerged from the pandemic, 2022 saw a fresh test following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, with live events canceled and music programming adjusted to stay “in line with the mood of the nation.” Clarke says she learned the BBC “is trusted to play the right music at the right time to meet the moment,” an approach she intends to maintain in 2023’s hopefully calmer waters. “When the industry focuses on the audience, we all win.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Kerry Condon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Kerry-Condon-GettyImages-1455621293-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Actor<br>Ireland</strong></p><p>Condon’s career is taking off. The Irish actor was recently nominated for an Oscar for her “Banshees of Inisherin” role, a film set on a remote island. Condon says getting to play Siobhan in Martin McDonagh’s Oscar-nominated film was challenging because she had to find moments to show the character’s glimpses of rage, sorrow and loneliness while still playing to her character’s youth and hopefulness. As for her nomination, she was with co-star Colin Farrell and his family when she found out. “It hasn’t fully sunk in yet. It’s literally a dream come true,” she says. “It was a moment I’ll remember forever.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Karima Damir</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Karima-Damir-1-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Director of A&R and Marketing, Sony Music Entertainment Middle East<br>United Arab Emirates</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">New sounds are Damir’s specialty — that comes in handy for one of the fastest-growing regions in the music industry. The strategic partnerships she’s established with Ghmza Creative Studios and Craft Media have propelled joint venture label Vibe Music Arabia to the forefront of artist development with signings such as Bader Al Shuaibi and Bashar al-Shatti, and to the top of the charts with Elissa’s “Damer” and Hamaki’s “Ya Fetenny.” Collab- orations in the coming year include “exploring disruptive collaborations between Arab and international artists of different genres… to create fresh music that challenges the status quo.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Kazia Davy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Kazia-Davy-IMG_4824-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Music Agent, UTA<br>U.K.</strong></p><p>The go-to agent for Afrobeats and hip-hop, Davy had a tremendous year booking her clients Wizkid, Trippie Redd and CKay, headlining major fest slots across Europe and selling out the largest shows of their careers. This is particularly impressive in the post-pandemic era with challenges including rising costs, industries not keeping up with demand, and changes in purchasing patterns. Recounting her proudest moment of this year, Davy says, “I came out with a strong roster and substantial artist growth. We just announced Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for Wizkid.

But after 16 years, Bravo expanded the franchise from the U.S. to the UAE. The latest city features women from all over the world who settled in Dubai — with representation from England, Kenya, Lebanon, Jamaica, the U.S. and Dubai. Al Madani, the series’ sole Emirati, says she took on the role as “an opportunity to do a massive PR campaign to fix the stereotype and wrong information that the western world has about Arab women, the Middle East and Muslims.” Whereas Milan expressed how she was “excited for people to see how amazing and diverse Dubai truly is.” Anticipating scrutiny from the entertainment industry and their respective communities, Kenyan-born Ayan says after joining the show, she felt more scrutinized when she broached topics that typically are “not allowed to be discussed outside [her] culture.” While British-born and reality TV veteran, Stanbury explained that both her age and previous experience benefited her when coming back to the small screen, and taught her how to “get the real story to [the] viewers.” American-born Brooks adds the reception of the series also relied on the reaction from Dubai residents. She concludes she never wanted to misrepresent the city, but as the season progressed, she became overwhelmed with joy after seeing how “well-received [the] show was both in the Middle East and the rest of the world.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>The Women of “The Real Housewives of Durban”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Real-Housewives-of-Durban.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Sorisha Naidoo, Toni “Annie” Mthembu, Nonkuleko “Nonku” Williams, JoJo Robinson, Slindile Ndlovu, Mbali Ngiba, Maria Valaskatzis<br>Cast Members<br>South Africa</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The Real Housewives of Durban” is the 24th international edition of the American franchise, and the second installment of the format set in South Africa. One of Showmax’s most popular series to stream when it premiered in January 2021, the show centers on powerful women in Durban, South Africa, highlighting their lives of opportunity and opulence. “Durban is a stunning city and the wealth of culture and beauty on display is perfect for tourism, and is exactly the sort of exposure Durban needed. We are the Miami of South Africa,” says Mthembu.

Forbidden from telling anyone about their roles, they were whisked away to remote New Zealand, where they spent a year and a half shooting the first season of the billion-dollar series, not feeling the effects of their career coup until it dropped on Prime last September. Clark says, “it was really interesting for all of us playing canon characters to be exploring how these characters become what we know them to be.” The series has been critically praised for casting actors of color in prominent roles. “People were so desperately proud to be able to see a version of themselves staring back at them,” says Nomvete, who’s half South African and half Iranian. “An interracial couple dressing up as myself and Owain [Arthur, who plays her husband, Prince Durin] for Halloween said, ‘Thank you.

Try to bring these two together, be humble but self-confident and make sure to communicate clearly what you wish for.” Mensah has key roles in BAFTA, Emmy and Golden Globe award-winning drama “The Crown.” She recently commissioned “The Gentlemen,” produced and directed by Guy Ritchie, and “Kaos,” created by Charlie Covell. Mensah finds her success with being a team player. “Be faithful to your peers, these are the people who will be your support network, collaborators and your greatest competition for the rest of your career,” she says. Hofem, in Germany, will introduce mystery drama series “Hello” and the crime series “Sleeping Dog” in 2023. She’s keen on bringing one’s own perspective to her work. “Always stay authentic and never try to be someone else,” says Hofem.

Louis Tomlinson’s Pollstar-recognized Top 200 Worldwide Tour was steered by newly upped agent Rowland. Says Bunel, “Strategy and creativity are at the epicenter of touring.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Miranda Wayland</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Miranda-Wayland-Biog-image-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Head of Intl.

Once I was on set, in her shoes, I understood and loved her deeply,” Tabasco says of playing the Sicilian sex worker. “Lucia is a symbol of freedom and audacity. She uses her body to exploit others but is never a victim of her choices.” Grannò says she felt a responsibility to do justice to her portrayal of fellow call girl Mia. “It’s hard to talk about female pleasure in a way that empowers and doesn’t reduce its complexity and importance,” she says, crediting series creator Mike White with carefully navigating the topic. Impacciatore says of her character Valentina, who is a diligent hotel manager and closeted lesbian: “Valentina’s sexual liberation is an epiphanic moment — a physical and emotional awakening about something she was trying to hide to herself.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Deborah Williams</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Deborah-Williams-Headshot-4-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>CEO, Creative Diversity Network<br>U.K.</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Williams never could have imagined receiving an Order of the British Empire or meeting the king of England, but her success as a leader at Creative Diversity Network and role in advocating for disability arts helped her do just that. “It feels like people don’t listen or respect my opinions because I’m a woman in the wider industry,” Williams says. “Through my role at CDN, I find the best way to get past it is to underpin my work with evidence. Using quotes or statistics or evidence from others — usually men — makes a difference, and once I show myself they can’t ignore me.”</p></li></ul><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black
