Instead, a cabal of producers reworked the track by having Jay-Z sing the iconic chorus on top of a distorted version of the track. Listen here:</p><p>This surprising inclusion of a decidedly non-rap song inspired us to take a look back at some of Jay-Z’s most unexpected samples, from the subtly unique to the more blatantly attention-grabbing.</p><h3>“Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)” – 1998</h3><p>[ Sample: “It’s the Hard-Knock Life” from the <a href=#>Broadway</a> musical&nbsp;Annie ]</p><p>Less than 15 seconds into this track, we hear the angelic voices of a Broadway cast singing the classic Annie anthem. No one saw that coming, but if anyone could make this work, it’s Jay-Z. Fifteen years later, this arguably remains Jay’s most unexpected — and effective — sample.</p><p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u8f55WWxPk]</p><h3>“Big Pimpin'” – 2000</h3><p>[ Sample: “Khosara, Khosara,” composed by&nbsp;Baligh Hamdy ]</p><p>Producer Timbaland wove a ’60s-era Egyptian tune into this smash hit — a move that wasn’t just surprising, but also, it turns out, legally actionable. The <a href=#>composer’s nephew sued Jay-Z</a> last year, seeking a portion of the rapper’s revenue earned from the song.</p><p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgoqrgc_0cM]</p><h3>“Takeover” – 2001</h3><p>[ Sample: “Five to One” by the Doors ]</p><p>Hov recorded this as a diss track aimed at his rival Nas, as well as Prodigy from Mobb Deep. But rather than enlisting the help of their hip hop predecessors, producer <a href=#>Kanye West</a> turned to a gritty 1968 Doors tune, adding a little rock-and-roll edge to the aggressive track.</p><p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMHtwyrt2X0]</p><h3>“Minority Report” – 2006</h3><p>[ Sample: “Non Ti Scordar Di Me” by&nbsp;Luciano Pavarotti ]</p><p>This track — a rumination on Hurricane Katrina, its aftermath, and the government’s response — opens with the somber notes of a Pavarotti tune. This brief combination of American hip-hop and Italian <a href=#>opera</a> results in a strangely&nbsp;assonant, haunting intro.</p><p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVgYqRX3_XY]</p><h3>“Jockin’ Jay-Z” – 2008</h3><p>[ Sample: “Wonderwall” by Oasis ]</p><p>This lesser-known track, originally intended for the album The Blueprint 3,&nbsp;borrowed lyrics from the iconic Oasis tune and is <a href=#>credited </a>as a sample. But it wasn’t all in good fun. Before singing the lyrics, Hov raps, “That bloke from Oasis said I couldn’t play guitar / Somebody should have told him I’m a f—ing rock star.” The Oasis reference here is certainly surprising — though perhaps less so when we learn it’s part of <a href=#>a minor feud</a>.</p><p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpvhn4CyqSE]</p><h3>“On to the Next One” – 2009</h3><p>[ Sample: “D.A.N.C.E.” by Justice ]</p><p>This tune, produced by Swizz Beatz, draws from a 2007 single from the French electronic duo Justice. But this sample’s a bit more subtle — and many Jay-Z fans were surprised when they learned where that extra layer in the beat originated.</p><p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM1RChZk1EU]</p><h3>“Ni**as in Paris” – 2011</h3><p>[ Sample: Dialogue from&nbsp;Blades of Glory ]</p><p>So, this isn’t a musical sample, but it’s certainly a surprising one. This Kanye/Jay-Z hybrid featured dialogue from the 2007 film&nbsp;Blades of Glory —&nbsp;perhaps most notably Will Ferrell’s line: “No one knows what it means, but it’s provocative. It gets the people going!”</p><p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pe7W1zJ5lnKedZH9xfZJoZ3BnYG58q63YZrFmm5iWu6%2Bxy6xkp6Giq66vrYyaZKWnn6B6o63CpGSarF2dtrR5lmakqKukYsKvsdepnJyslZl6tK3MqaOeq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
