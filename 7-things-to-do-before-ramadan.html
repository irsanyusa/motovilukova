Renew your intentions</h3></p><p>Before the start of Ramadan, renewing your intentions and preparing yourself mentally and spiritually for the month ahead is important. Reflect on the significance of fasting and the goals you hope to achieve during this blessed period. Purify your intentions, seeking Allah's pleasure and forgiveness in all your actions and deeds.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>2. Increase your knowledge</h3></p><p>Take time to deepen your understanding of Ramadan by studying its significance, rulings, and etiquette. Attend lectures, read books, or listen to podcasts that discuss the virtues of fasting and the spiritual benefits of Ramadan. Enhancing your knowledge will enrich your experience and help you make the most of this sacred time.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>3. Make a Ramadan plan</h3></p><p>Prepare a Ramadan plan outlining your goals, objectives, and daily routines. Set realistic targets for Quran recitation, prayers, and acts of charity. Allocate time for spiritual reflection, self-assessment, and supplication. Planning will help you stay organised and focused throughout Ramadan.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>4. Start fasting practice</h3></p><p>Ease into fasting by practising voluntary fasts in the days leading up to Ramadan. This will help your body adjust to the changes in eating and sleeping patterns and prepare you for the longer fasts ahead. Begin with fasting on Mondays and Thursdays or during the white days of the lunar month to build your stamina and discipline.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>5. Seek forgiveness and repentance</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Take this opportunity to seek forgiveness for past sins and shortcomings. Engage in sincere repentance and reflection, asking Allah for His mercy and guidance. Perform acts of charity, offer voluntary prayers, and recite istighfar (seeking forgiveness) regularly to cleanse your heart and soul before Ramadan.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>6. Purify your environment</h3></p><p>Create a conducive environment for spiritual growth and worship by purifying your surroundings. Cleanse your home, workplace, and personal space of distractions and negative influences. Surround yourself with positive reminders of Allah's presence, such as Quranic verses, dhikr beads, or Islamic artwork.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>7. Plan for charity and good deeds</h3></p><p>Prepare to maximise your charitable giving and good deeds during Ramadan. Set aside funds for zakat, sadaqah, and other forms of charity, and identify worthy causes and organisations to support. Volunteer your time and skills to help those in need through community service, feeding the hungry, or assisting the less fortunate.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-cd1665ed-6c66-4d2a-82ad-6e8ee1d07a75 data-caption="Plan for charity [Shutterstock]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/7qzktkpTURBXy85MzY1YmZjOGM1MWQzYjM2ZDM3NTMyOGIwYzQ1YjVkYi5qcGeSlQMAAM0B9s0BJJUCzQH2zQEkwsM></span><p>The arrival of Ramadan is a time of great anticipation and spiritual preparation for Muslims worldwide.
