With a&nbsp;string of&nbsp;blockbuster films under his belt, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;also one of&nbsp;the wealthiest actors in&nbsp;Hollywood, his <a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grossing</a> over 3&nbsp;billion dollars at&nbsp;the box office. However, behind his fame and success lies a&nbsp;background of&nbsp;loneliness and personal sorrow.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;comes from humble beginnings.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c8/8d5/71ac145c1bb3619e6055176344.jpg><p>Karen Bystedt/Coleman-Rayner/EAST NEWS</p><p>Keanu Reeves endured a&nbsp;tumultuous <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a> marked by&nbsp;significant upheaval and loss. Born to&nbsp;Patricia Taylor and Samuel Reeves in&nbsp;Lebanon, he&nbsp;faced familial instability from a&nbsp;young age. His father abandoned the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> when Keanu was only three years old.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare moment of&nbsp;public vulnerability, the actor recounted the moment in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>. They sat quietly on&nbsp;a&nbsp;veranda and stared at&nbsp;the dark sky. The next day, his father left them at&nbsp;the airport. Then, for the next 10&nbsp;years, there was no&nbsp;contact whatsoever until he&nbsp;saw him again for one last time at&nbsp;13.</p><p>Raised by&nbsp;his single mother, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>costume designer</a>, Reeves often had to&nbsp;move, which resulted in&nbsp;him attending four different high schools before dropping out at&nbsp;17. Their nomadic lifestyle led them to&nbsp;reside in&nbsp;various places, including Hawaii, New York, Canada, and even a&nbsp;brief period in&nbsp;Australia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb7/d26/c143095e66903d4e6c16ad378b.jpg><p>Keanu isn’t an&nbsp;only child, though. He&nbsp;has three sisters—Kim Reeves, Karina Miller and Emma Reeves.</p><p>Kim was born two years after him, at&nbsp;around the time his parents decided to&nbsp;split. Eventually, the family moved to&nbsp;Toronto, where his mother met and married music promoter Robert Miller, with whom she had a&nbsp;daughter, Karina, in&nbsp;1976. Keanu also has a&nbsp;half-sister, Emma Reeves, born in&nbsp;1980, through his father.</p><p>Keanu Reeves and Kim spent much of&nbsp;their childhood in&nbsp;Toronto, where they were often looked after by&nbsp;nannies due to&nbsp;their mother’s frequent travel for work. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, Kim revealed their upbringing was lonely, but that the siblings managed to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;their circumstances.</p><p>In&nbsp;1991, their close relationship was put to&nbsp;the test, when Kim was diagnosed with leukemia. Keanu didn’t hesitate and took on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;her caretaker during her 10-year battle with the disease. She said he&nbsp;provided unwavering support and comfort and described how he&nbsp;would sit with her, hold her hand, and offer solace during her most painful moments.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;hasn’t had an&nbsp;easy time when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;love either.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b4/ae2/deb6ae52f2a6ea6fd21b124be7.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News<span>, </span>Richard Shotwell/Invision/East News</p><p>He&nbsp;never married or&nbsp;had kids, and there are more heartbreaking tragedies that explain that.</p><p>In&nbsp;1999, the year <i>The Matrix</i> premiered, he&nbsp;was expecting a&nbsp;baby with his then girlfriend Jennifer Syme. Unfortunately, at&nbsp;the 6-month <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mark</a> in&nbsp;the pregnancy the baby, whom they named Ava, was stillborn. This devastating event strained their relationship, ultimately leading to&nbsp;their decision to&nbsp;part ways just weeks after Ava’s stillbirth.</p><p>Just two years later, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was preparing to&nbsp;begin shooting <i>The Matrix</i> sequels, yet another heartbreaking loss occurred. As&nbsp;Syme was leaving a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>party</a> at&nbsp;Marilyn Manson’s house in&nbsp;Los Angeles, she had a&nbsp;serious car accident, which turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fatal. Struggling with grief and dealing with his sister Kim’s cancer diagnosis, he&nbsp;was forced to&nbsp;take time off from shooting <i>The Matrix</i> sequels.</p><p>While Reeves has never openly discussed the tragedy, it&nbsp;deeply impacted him, and he&nbsp;refrained from public relationships until he&nbsp;surprised everyone by&nbsp;introducing his current girlfriend to&nbsp;the world, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;red carpet event in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>The girlfriend, Alexandra Grant, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>visual artist</a> and although much of&nbsp;their relationship remains private, they won’t refrain from appearing together on&nbsp;red carpets. He’s looking absolutely smitten and she’s beaming.</p><p><h2>His tough life perhaps explains why he’s such a&nbsp;private man.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e56/2a1/fac7f55349b07bde8008d70ef0.jpg><p>Fine Line Features/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News<span>, </span>East News</p><p>In&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>John Wick</i></a> films, fans witness a&nbsp;resonance between Keanu’s portrayal of&nbsp;the grieving character and his personal encounters with loss and love. The actor himself has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>acknowledged</a> before that he&nbsp;infused his own life experiences into the character, emphasizing the depth of&nbsp;grief depicted in&nbsp;the role. He&nbsp;views grief as&nbsp;a&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the foundations for John Wick and relates it&nbsp;to&nbsp;his own experiences of&nbsp;the enduring presence of&nbsp;grief in&nbsp;one’s life.</p><p>However, Symes’ passing wasn’t either the first or&nbsp;only time Keanu experienced the loss of&nbsp;a&nbsp;loved one. In&nbsp;1993, he&nbsp;faced yet another devastating tragedy when his close friend and fellow actor, River Phoenix, unexpectedly passed away at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;23. Keanu and River <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>developed</a> a&nbsp;strong bond while working together on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>I&nbsp;Love You to&nbsp;Death</i></a>, as&nbsp;they were the same age and shared similar experiences of&nbsp;navigating fame and early adulthood in&nbsp;Hollywood.</p><p>Phoenix’s untimely death deeply affected the star of&nbsp;<i>John Wick</i>, who was filming fan favorite <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Speed</i></a> at&nbsp;the time. His co-star Sandra Bullock noted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;1994 interview that he&nbsp;was deeply hurting, though hid it&nbsp;from others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/652/2f0/371ddc5400bcfc82d427b4c22d.jpg><p>ROBYN BECK/AFP/East News<span>, </span>Schneider-Press/Matthias/SIPA/Sipa Press/East News</p><p>And the actor keeps hiding everything from the public regarding his personal life. Despite his long-standing success in&nbsp;Hollywood, he&nbsp;maintains a&nbsp;mysterious and enigmatic persona. While he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fulfills</a> his promotional duties for films and attends red carpet events with grace and professionalism, he&nbsp;remains elusive and prefers to&nbsp;keep his private matters guarded and out of&nbsp;the public eye.</p><p>Still, at&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>59&nbsp;years old</a>, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;adored by&nbsp;the public and has even been notably dubbed the «internet’s boyfriend» and «the most wholesome person alive.» The fans’ affection for him is&nbsp;such that in&nbsp;2019&nbsp;an online <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>petition</a> asking for his nomination as&nbsp;Time’s Person of&nbsp;the Year accumulated over 170,000&nbsp;signatures.</p><p>Although taken aback by&nbsp;the attention, he&nbsp;acknowledges the positivity surrounding him, and particularly appreciates the embrace of&nbsp;his roles in&nbsp;movies such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>John Wick</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Always Be&nbsp;My&nbsp;Maybe</i></a><i>. </i>However, it&nbsp;does demonstrate both his discomfort with the limelight and his gratitude for the support.</p><p><h2>Nevertheless, he&nbsp;always gives back to&nbsp;people.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/383/6a4/d7691257ada2729ae85562acd5.jpg><p>PHOTOlink/Everett Collection/East News<span>, </span>LGjr-RG, PacificCoastNews/EAST NEWS</p><p>Keanu’s personal challenges seem to&nbsp;have instilled a&nbsp;profound kindness in&nbsp;him, that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;less than eager to&nbsp;share publicly. Stories of&nbsp;his generosity often surface from various sources online. From gifting Harley Davidsons to&nbsp;his entire stunt team on&nbsp;<i>The Matrix </i>to&nbsp;regularly providing free meals for staff during filming, his acts of&nbsp;kindness reflect a&nbsp;genuine desire to&nbsp;uplift those around him.</p><p>A&nbsp;Reddit <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>user</a> who worked on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Chain Reaction</i></a><i> </i>described him as&nbsp;a&nbsp;«genuinely very nice guy to&nbsp;work with» and «definitely kind-hearted.» Plus, he&nbsp;remembered him «going out of&nbsp;his way to&nbsp;give [his] friend a&nbsp;ride to&nbsp;the repair shop to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;his car.»</p><p>But, perhaps one of&nbsp;the most popular <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stories</a> about Keanu broke in&nbsp;1997, when he&nbsp;was captured in&nbsp;a&nbsp;photograph sitting beside a&nbsp;homeless man on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;the road. According to&nbsp;reports, he&nbsp;approached the man, engaged in&nbsp;conversation, shared drinks and snacks, and attentively listened to&nbsp;his life story.</p><p>On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;all of&nbsp;that, he’s also known to&nbsp;have quietly given away millions of&nbsp;dollars to&nbsp;several charities. So, despite enduring such emotional turmoil throughout his life, Keanu has managed to&nbsp;avoid the destructive paths often associated with fame, and showcased an&nbsp;inspiring resilience in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;adversity. His genuine acts of&nbsp;kindness, combined with his humility, are what sparked the global fascination surrounding him and why he’s so&nbsp;deeply loved by&nbsp;countless people.</p><p>Veteran actor Val Kilmer also could teach the world a&nbsp;thing or&nbsp;two about resilience. After losing his voice to&nbsp;throat cancer, the <i>Top Gun</i> star never once gave up&nbsp;on&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;live life to&nbsp;the fullest, and even became more creative than ever.
