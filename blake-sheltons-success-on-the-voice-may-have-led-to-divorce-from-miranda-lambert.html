To this day, country fans are curious to know what really went down between this iconic duo.</strong></p><p>Miranda Lambert recently opened up, noting that part of where her relationship with Shelton went wrong might have been The Voice. It’s important to clarify, she was never upset about his success on the series. She instead figured out that she didn’t want to be in the public eye 24/7.</p><p>“I’m a Scorpio, so I’m already very private and protective,” Lambert <a href=#>said</a>. “Choosing the job I chose — I mean, I get onstage, I’m in front of people. But I didn’t choose random photos of moments when I wasn’t at work.”</p><p>When the series first started, the country star explained that TMZ tried to come to Nashville to get photos of Shelton. While they were able to tell paparazzi to go away in Nashville, they couldn’t do the same in Los Angeles. The singer shared that living part time in Los Angeles with Shelton made her realize that she didn’t want to be apart of Hollywood full time.</p><p>Even though Lambert has expressed her discontent in the Hollywood spotlight, she stayed by Shelton’s side. Since divorcing from The Voice coach, Lambert has remained as one of the biggest names in country music. The singer <a href=#>described</a> the divorce as “horrible — like the death of something,” which she channeled into her highly rated double LP, The Weight of These Wings.</p><p>She now reportedly resides in the state of Tennessee with her new husband Brendan McLoughlin. Lambert met McLoughlin while he worked as security on Good Morning America. They wed in 2019.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-history-of-blake-shelton-miranda-lambert>The History of Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert</h2><p>Lambert and Shelton originally met while performing for the CMT 100 Greatest Duets Concert in 2005. Together they sang “You’re the Reason God Made Oklahoma” by David Frizzell and Shelly West. At the time, Shelton was married to his high school sweetheart, Kaynette Gern.</p><p>This couple began dating in 2006 when Shelton filed for divorce from Gern. Both parties noted that their relationship was tough due to their similar music genre, but they were determined to make it work. After years of determination, Shelton popped the question to Lambert in May 2010, they tied the knot soon later in 2011.</p><p>Shelton got his job on The Voice soon after. During the time the couple implemented a rule to never spend more than two weeks apart. Shelton explained that Lambert often kept that rule because he was unable to leave the show’s set often enough.</p><p><a href=#>Rumors began</a> swirling in a possible affair between Shelton and singer Cady Groves in 2013. Even though the couple denied rumors together, Lambert told backstage reporters at the ACM Awards 2013 that “divorce is not an option.”</p><p>In November 2014, Lambert went public about needing more privacy. Since Shelton became a recognizable name on The Voice, the couple was often seen in the public. Lambert explained that their only private place was their shared home. The following year, the couple announced their divorce. Shortly after the divorce, Shelton began dating his current wife, Gwen Stefani. Lambert went on to date before marrying her current husband Brendan McLoughlin.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-04-at-9.09.57-PM.png alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Recap: Prince is Going to Next Week’s Finale After Double Elimination" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopaxlo6qwpLHSrGSopl2ptaZ51aignJ1doq66ecearZ5lnJqxbsDOZpuirp%2BnsKZ5xaumpmWdnr%2BiusOaZKWZnZeys8CO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
