Hitler or Napoleon? <a href=#>Charles Dickens</a> or Jane Austen? That depends on how you look at it.</p><p>When we set out to rank the significance of historical figures, we decided to not approach the project the way&nbsp;historians might, through a principled assessment of their individual achievements. Instead, we evaluated each person by aggregating millions of traces of opinions into a computational data-centric analysis. We ranked historical figures just as <a href=#>Google</a> ranks web pages, by integrating a diverse set of measurements about their reputation into a single consensus value.</p><p>Significance is related to fame but measures something different. Forgotten U.S. President&nbsp;Chester A. Arthur (who we rank as the 499th most significant person in history) is more historically significant than young pop singer Justin Bieber (currently ranked 8633), even though he may have a less devoted following and lower contemporary name recognition. Historically significant figures leave statistical evidence of their presence behind, if one knows where to look for it, and we used <a href=#>several data sources</a> to fuel our ranking algorithms, including Wikipedia, scanned books and Google n-grams.</p><p>To fairly compare contemporary figures like Britney Spears against the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, we adjusted for the fact that today’s stars will fade from living memory over the next several generations. Intuitively it is clear that Britney Spears’ mindshare will decline substantially over the next 100 years, as people who grew up hearing her are replaced by new generations. But Aristotle’s reputation will be much more stable because this transition occurred long ago. The reputation he has now is presumably destined to endure. By analyzing traces left in millions of scanned books, we can measure just how fast this decay occurs, and correct for it.</p><p>We don’t expect you will agree with everyone chosen for the top 100, or exactly where they are placed. But we trust you will agree that most selections are reasonable: a quarter of them are philosophers or major religious figures, plus eight scientists/inventors, thirteen giants in literature and music, and three of the greatest artists of all time.&nbsp;We have validated our results by comparing them against several standards: published rankings by historians, public polls, even in predicting the prices of autographs, paintings, and baseball cards. Since we analyzed the&nbsp;English Wikipedia, we admittedly measured the interests and judgments of primarily the Western, English-speaking community. Our algorithms also don’t include many women at the very top: Queen Elizabeth I (1533-1603) [at number 13] is the top ranked woman in history according to our analysis. This is at least partially due to women being underrepresented in Wikipedia.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async width=1616 height=2327 alt=9781107041370 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ideas.time.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/12/9781107041370.jpeg sizes="(max-width: 1616px) 100vw, 1616px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>Each year since 1927, <i>TIME</i> Magazine&nbsp;has selected an official Person of the Year, recognizing an individual who “has done the most to influence the events of the year.” Our rankings provide a way to see how well these selections have stood up over time.&nbsp;Adolf Hitler [7] proves to be the most significant Person of the Year ever. <a href=#>Albert Einstein</a> [19] was the most significant modern individual never selected for the annual honor, though <i>TIME</i> did name him Person of the Century in 1999. Elvis Presley [69] is the highest ranked figure that has been completely dissed: no author or artist has ever so been honored.</p><p>The least significant Person of the Year proves to be Harlow Curtice [224326], the president of General Motors for five years during the 1950s who increased capital spending in a time of recession, which helped spur a recovery of the American economy.&nbsp;Other obscure selections include Hugh Samuel “Iron Pants” Johnson [32927], who Franklin Roosevelt appointed to head the depression-era National Recovery Administration, and fired less than a year later. John Sirica [47053] was the District Court Judge who ordered President Nixon to turn over tape recordings in the Watergate Scandal. David Ho [66267] is credited with developing the combination therapy that provided the first effective treatment for AIDS. His contributions to human health arguably deserve a better significance rank than our algorithms gave him here.</p><p><strong>The 100 Most Significant Figures in History</strong></p><p>1 Jesus</p><p>2 Napoleon</p><p>3 Muhammad</p><p>4 William Shakespeare</p><p>5 Abraham Lincoln</p><p>6 George Washington</p><p>7 Adolf Hitler</p><p>8 Aristotle</p><p>9 Alexander the Great</p><p>10 Thomas Jefferson</p><p>11 Henry VIII of England</p><p>12 Charles Darwin</p><p>13 Elizabeth I of England</p><p>14 Karl Marx</p><p>15 Julius Caesar</p><p>16 Queen Victoria</p><p>17 Martin Luther</p><p>18 Joseph Stalin</p><p>19 Albert Einstein</p><p>20 Christopher Columbus</p><p>21 Isaac Newton</p><p>22 Charlemagne</p><p>23 Theodore Roosevelt</p><p>24 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</p><p>25 Plato</p><p>26 Louis XIV of France</p><p>27 Ludwig van Beethoven</p><p>28 Ulysses S.
