First introduced in season seven of the show, we’ve seen some of the most exciting team dances since then. Here are the top ten best team dances ranked.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-team-who-you-gonna-call-season-21>1. Team Who You Gonna Call? (Season 21)</h2><p>Pulling off a Ghostbusters-themed freestyle for their team dance, Team Who You Gonna Call? delivers a high-energy routine with lots of great choreography.

The inventive choreography of the routine gave judge Bruno Tonioli goosebumps.

Team Tango (Season 14)</h2><p>A team named after a dance routine would certainly specialize in Tango choreography and synchronism.
