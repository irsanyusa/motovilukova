Let’s answer all your questions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V52CEH2Ykk</p>Preview of The Masked Singer 80’s Night</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 9</h2><p>The Moose’s clues started with an outside shot of a house, like in a sitcom. He’s singing his clues while he repairs a teddy bear. He sings, “born in the Midwest just a normal guy then moved to the city” where he met his wife. One of the men in black comes out in an apron and holds a bag of ice on his hand while he mentions she “coached” him in love. The Moose then mentions moving West, while we see a gift tag with “To: Santa, From: Moose” written on it. He got his “hooves in the door” doing what he does best.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ MACAW? CLUES DECODED + PREDICTION!</a></strong></p><p>We see one of the men in black in a letterman jacket with a black bird and an “M” on it. He mentioned ending up a “king of your favorite show” while swatting away a hand trying to take his frosty mug. A plate of Chicago-style hot dogs is shown, with pickle spears in the bun. The clues ended with a spotlight on him and him exclaiming “L’chaim!” Once his performance was over, we got one last clue from actress Charlene Tilton. She held up a card that said “ACCEPTANCE SPEECH” and the Moose explained, “I haven’t had much use for any of those…I have a few in the trunk of my car or in the bottom of my suit coat.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Moose</h2><p>Robin thought this might be an actor who was nominated for awards but didn’t win, like Kelsey Grammar, Woody Harrelson, or Ted Danson, but he didn’t hear it in the voice. He finally landed on Jon Lovitz. Jenny liked Robin’s Cheers mention, guessing it could be George Wendt or John Ratzenberger. Ken predicted John Goodman. And Nicole rounded out the predictions, guessing Ed O’Neill.</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO IS ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ CALIFORNIA ROLL?
