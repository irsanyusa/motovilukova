She discussed judging the current season of America’s Got Talent: Fantasy League. Klum shared entertaining behind-the-scenes insights and made it clear she plays to win.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heidi-klum-admits-she-s-the-most-competitive-judge>Heidi Klum Admits She’s The Most “Competitive” Judge</h2><p>Klum made it clear she plays AGT to win. When asked who is most competitive, she instantly pointed to herself, insisting she outpaces all her co-judges in drive and determination. Klum does not take losing lightly, and she makes no apologies about her hardcore competitive spirit when it comes to Reality TV domination.</p><p>Throughout the interview, Klum’s intense passion for scouting top-tier talent and leading her team to victory shone through. She described becoming deeply emotional when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Howie Mandel</a> snatched away the Ramadhani Brothers.</p><p>Klum lucked out by drawing the longest straw this season. This meant she consistently got to pick contestants before the other judges, giving her an early advantage. Creator Simon Cowell unfortunately drew the shortest straw, forcing him to choose last every round.</p><p>“I’m so competitive that I feel like last time I fell, and I think that Simon actually tripped me to fall,” Klum said. “I think they would they would trying to take me out from all angles they were trying to like manipulate all situation they were all mad because I have the best team.”</p><p>Klum also suspects more cutthroat tactics from the fellow judges, cheekily accusing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowell</a> of literally tripping her on set before. Though said lightheartedly, Klum’s competitiveness extends beyond the Fantasy League, and she does not shy away from playful banter with her co-judges.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heidi-klum-talks-about-her-50th-birthday-party>Heidi Klum Talks About Her 50th Birthday Party</h2><p>During the same interview, Klum then detailed her lavish 50th birthday party thrown last June. With a glamorous 1920s theme, she described gorgeous flapper-style dresses with feathered hair.</p><p>Friends and family flew in from around the world to celebrate, including loved ones from Germany and New York. Klum said her husband went all out, making it an unforgettable night surrounded by dear guests.</p><p>While Klum showed off some dance skills, she joked it was nothing she’d formally learned in lessons yet. However, she’s excited to put new moves like the cha-cha to use for upcoming birthdays.</p><p>When asked about recently getting two new puppies, Klum explained her motivation. After losing their beloved dog, her hesitant husband eventually agreed to additions while he was away touring.</p><p>Klum surprised him by adopting not one but two adorable German Shorthaired Pointer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">puppies</a>. She described the chaos of puppy parenthood – the constant pooping, peeing, and the need for indoor gates to contain them.</p><p>Though a handful, Klum loves watching the bonded pups play together. She gave them cute German names, Jer and Ushi, as they brought some lively new energy into the family.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-961816424-1-scaled.jpg alt="Jesse McCartney Releases New Song “Faux Fur”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x56gnaFdoLm2uYyrnJqbpKh6tbuMoaawoZViuqK6w56jZpuRobmqusZmn56qXZi8rrzEraCtoaaaerC6jJqerWWWlru1rdKyZKWdkZzCpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
